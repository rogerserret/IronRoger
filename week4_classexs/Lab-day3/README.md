This project contains the definition of the main steps for a cleaning data process. Most of them should be applied in the EDA process of every data analytics project. So read carefully and see how to use them!

All the details are in the Jupyter Notebook EDA_process.ipynb. To show the impact of each of the steps we have used a dataset called dataset.csv.
