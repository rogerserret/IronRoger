# A/B testing 

## Tableau visualizations

We have around a 15% more customers that used the test version than the control one:

I have analyzed how the new process affects the final confirmation by taking a look at the unique visits, so I can see the behaviour of each user on each visit:

It looks as the new process really has an impact on the final conversion and we can confirm that just checking the statistical values:
