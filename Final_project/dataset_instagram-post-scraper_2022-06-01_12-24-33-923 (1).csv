————————⁠
In 2022, the Spirited Awards nomination process will return to recognizing the previously accredited categories such as the 'establishments,' 'people,' 'books,' and 'writing and media' categories as well as the “Timeless” awards. Taking into consideration COVID-19's impact on the industry over the past 2 years, the Spirited Awards Committee has decided to retire the “High Volume” awards. In addition, the “Philanthropy” award will also be retired. ⁠
