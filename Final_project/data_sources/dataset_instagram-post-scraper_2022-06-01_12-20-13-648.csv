2 Tbsp Maple Syrup, or simple syrup
1/4 Cup Peach Puree
Fresh peaches, pitted cherries and strawberries.

In a pitcher add all ingredients and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. 
Add ice to pitcher and serve. 
To serve, add ice to a glass and fill 3/4 of the way full with sangria.

,"Let’s make the drink of the summer! Yes, it’s true they are saying the drink of the summer is the Dirty Shirley. But who is they anyway?

I personally believe blended drinks will be the winner this summer but who knows, maybe it is the dirty Shirley. What do you think the drink of the summer is?

Let’s first make a dirty Shirley to help us decide:
1 oz Grenadine, I prefer cherry juice instead but up to you!
2 oz Vodka
7-8 oz Lemon Lime Soda (y’all know I hate soda so I use @zevia when soda is needed!)
Ice
Garnish: cherry on top!

Add all ingredients into a glass filled with ice. 
Mix together to chill completely. 
Garnish & enjoy!

,"Another easy weekend cocktail, Peach Bourbon Slush! I’m on a blended kick, can’t you tell?

But seriously, I think blended drinks are so fun and easy to make and they don’t have to be super sugary like we associate most blended drinks (I’m using @beasthealth here). I also wanted to give my bourbon lovers some love with this one. Use what’s fresh and it tastes that much better!

Let’s get into it
1 Peach or Nectarine Chopped, Frozen is preferred 
2 oz Bourbon
1 oz Fresh Lemon Juice
2 tsp Honey
Optional: 1-2 sprigs Fresh Mint
Garnish: Lemon wheel and mint
Ice, if not using frozen fruit

In a blender add all ingredients, including mint if you’re using. 
Blend together until smooth. 
Pour into a glass and enjoy!

,"Have you had an Irish coffee before? Better question, have you had an Irish coffee from the Buena Vista in San Francisco?

If you haven’t, this is your sign to do both! It truly is a sight to be seen visiting the Buena Vista and seeing the amount of Irish Coffees being made daily. 

A little history - the Buena Vista Cafe in San Francisco introduced the Irish coffee to the US back in 1952. Jack Koepoler, the then owner of the Buena Vista, was on an international flight home and was rerouted and served the “Irish Coffee"" created by Joe Sheridan at the Shannon Airport in Ireland. Determined to get this recipe right, Koepoler had to find the right whiskey, measurements and of course cream. The cream was aged for 48 hours and frothed perfectly to float to the top. Once the recipe was perfected, the rest is history. They still serve the same recipe to this day. It truly is an experience to be had.

Next time you’re in San Francisco, put this on your list!

I like to sub tequila for Mezcal here but really the choice is up to you! When using coconut make sure to use real coconut milk and not coconut cream. The coconut cream has so much sugar so just try to use the best coconut milk your local store has to offer!

3/4 oz fresh lime juice
1/2 oz Agave syrup
1 oz Coconut Milk
3/4 oz Cointreau
2 oz Mezcal
Ice
Garnish: Tajin, lime wheel, edible flowers

Add all ingredients into a cocktail shaker and shake. 
Strain into a glass filled with ice and rimmed with Tajin.

3/4 oz gin
3/4 oz Maraschino liqueur
3/4 oz green chartreuse
Ice
Garnish: lime wheel or Luxardo cherry

,"This is my go to cocktail when I’m low on ingredients or just need an easy cocktail to make: The Whiskey Sour

This 4 ingredient cocktail is too good (it’s a classic for a reason) it has yet to let me down. But have you noticed a trend? There’s many similarities with the whiskey sour (the Daiquiri, the margarita) they all have similar measurements of spirit, citrus, and sweetness? See… once you know a classic you truly can use this formula for so many other cocktails! If you want something different, you can always try an Amaretto sour too 😉

Let’s get into this one:
2 oz Bourbon, or whiskey (All bourbon is whiskey but not all whiskey is bourbon)
3/4 oz Lemon Juice, freshly squeezed obvi
1/2 oz simple syrup
1 egg white
Angostura bitters
Ice
Garnish: citrus wheel or Luxardo cherries

In a cocktail shaker add bourbon, simple syrup, lemon juice, and egg white. 
Don’t add ice rather give it a dry shake, about 15 seconds. 
Add ice and shake again, about 30 seconds. 
Double strain into a rocks glass (you can add ice if you’d like) or a chilled coupe glass. 
Garnish & enjoy this classic cocktail!

,"Looking for a fun way to stay hydrated this summer? Let’s use my favorite summer flavors and create a mocktail using @liquidiv Concord Grape Hydration Multiplier. This mocktail is a perfect way to cool off, rehydrate and enjoy a non-alcoholic beverage. Best of all, Liquid I.V. hydrates 2x faster than water alone!

My favorite part about making mocktails in the summertime is those fresh garnishes! For this drink you can garnish with fresh edible flowers, dehydrated citrus or even your favorite herb. No matter what you do, don’t forget to garnish your drink… mocktail or not, you deserve it! 

Summer Grape Refresher
1 Liquid I.V. Concord Grape Hydration Multiplier 
½ oz Freshly Squeezed Lemon Juice
2 oz Pineapple juice
1 tsp Freshly grated Ginger
8 oz Water, or sparkling water
Garnish: Fresh Mint

In a glass add Liquid I.V. Concord Grape Hydration Multiplier and water.
Using a hand mixer, mix until powder is dissolved.
Add pineapple juice, lemon juice and freshly grated fresh ginger.
Mix together & garnish!

,"The song of the summer meets the drink of the summer: The Frozen Cosmopolitan 

I think Carrie Bradshaw would drink this in the summer, don’t you? It’s important to note, frozen or not, that not all cranberry juice is the same! Stay away from the cranberry cocktail juice (loaded with added sugars and stuff) and opt for the Pure Cranberry Juice - it tastes much better I think!

So let’s get into it:
2 oz Vodka, or citrus vodka
3/4 oz Cointreau, or orange liqueur of choice
3/4 oz Fresh lime juice
3/4 oz Cranberry Juice
1 or 2 Cups Ice
Garnish: lime wheel & edible flowers

In a blender (im using the gorgeous @beasthealth ) add all ingredients and blend until smooth. 
Pour into your favorite glass, I recommend a coupe
Garnish & enjoy!

,"This recipe is trending again so I had to share, this ‘simple’ gin & tonic 

Gin and tonics are just that, simple. But make it your own with some fancy ice cubes, citrus, or even peppercorns. When I use empress gin I love to add citrus to watch the gin change colors. Your gin & tonic journey is ultimately up to you!

For this cocktail:
2 oz @empress1908gin 
Top with @fevertreemixers
Splash of fresh lemon juice

In a glass add ice
Add in your gin and lemon juice
Top with tonic & enjoy!

,"Citrus Orange Blossom Gin Fizz by our first ever Join Jules Cocktail Club winner @sophiesandsss 

The theme was Spring & I think she absolutely nailed this recipe. Today just so happens to be World Cocktail day so what better way to celebrate than with a cocktail recipe made by YOU! For those of you who don’t know, I have a Facebook Cocktail Club and each month (this being our first) we hold a fun cocktail competition where the members make a cocktail based on the theme I choose, I taste test and pick my top 3 (or sometimes 4) and then the club members vote on their favorite! Winner gets (bragging rights obviously) but I make them a video in my studio that I post and share on all platforms & they are highlighted in my newsletter! It’s all good fun to come together, try new recipes, and sip & enjoy together. 

So here is @sophiesandsss recipe:

Into a shaker:
2 oz gin
0.5 oz orange blossom water
0.5 oz homemade grapefruit simple syrup
0.5 oz freshly squeezed grapefruit juice
Add ice & shake!
Pour into glass of choice over ice and top with a splash of Prosecco. Bonus points for flowers in your ice cubes 🌸 Top with a slice of grapefruit and enjoy the citrus and brightness of spring!

,"CEO of spritz season meet margarita queen 🤝 say hello to an Aperol Coconut Margarita

Who said Aperol doesn’t belong in a margarita? It certainly wasn’t me. This may be my new favorite. You get a little bitter and sweet from the Aperol, creaminess from the coconut milk, and of course all the delicious flavors from a margarita. This is my kind of heaven, what say you?

2 oz Tequila (I used @elmayortequila reposado but use what you like)
1 oz Aperol
3/4 oz @cointreau 🍊
3/4 oz Coconut milk
3/4 oz fresh lime juice
1/2 oz simple syrup
Ice
Garnish: Tajin, lime wheel & marigold

In a cocktail shaker add all ingredients, add ice, and shake!
Rim glass with lime juice and rim with Tajin. 
Add ice and strain into glass. 
Garnish & enjoy!

If you’re ready for an Aperol Spritz this one is for you. This blood orange spritz couldn’t be easier and can honestly be subbed out for your favorite citrus, instead of blood orange juice you could do grapefruit or even orange! Make it how you like it always. But remember, if you haven’t had an Aperol spritz this year… this is your time to shine!

3 oz Prosecco
3 oz Aperol, I like to do 4 oz here (😉)
1 oz Blood Orange Juice, freshly squeezed or I don’t want it
Top with sparkling water (you can use @sanpellegrino_official or @topochicousa here)
Ice
Garnish: citrus wheels cut in half

In a spritz glass add crushed ice. 
Pour in Prosecco, Aperol, and blood orange juice. 
Top with desired sparkling water.

Here’s my riff:
3/4 oz Lemon Juice, freshly squeezed
1/2 oz Cucumber simple syrup
1.5 oz Gin
1 oz Pimm’s No. 1
Ice
Ginger ale or soda water
Garnish: cucumber slices, mint, lemon wheel, strawberries & marigold

Two part series for a Mothers Day classic cocktail the French 75. I think this is a perfect drink for mom this weekend whether you’re doing the classic or frozen. I will say, if you’re doing the frozen French 75 I wouldn’t go top shelf with the champagne since you’re diluting with that ice. 

Ready for this one? It’s the same as the classic French 75 recipe
2 oz Gin
3/4 oz Lemon Juice
1/2 oz Simple Syrup
4 or 5 oz of champagne
Ice, about 1 cup
Garnish: sage leaves

Add all ingredients in your blender. 
Blend until smooth. 
Pour into a coupe glass. 
Garnish & enjoy!

,"Looking to make a cocktail this weekend but don’t have a lot of ingredients? Well, do I have a cocktail for you… The Bees Knees 

This cocktail is only 3 ingredients: Gin, Lemon Juice, & Honey Syrup. I know what you’re thinking, Jules I don’t have a honey syrup! Don’t worry, I’ve got a quick fix for that too - if you have honey, you have honey syrup. Just add equal parts honey to hot water in a mason jar and shake until the honey has dissolved to make a syrup. See? Easy right!

Let’s get into it:
2 oz Gin
3/4 oz Lemon Juice
1/2 oz Honey Syrup

In a cocktail shaker add all ingredients. 
Add ice to a coupe glass, add water and set aside to let chill the glass. 
Add ice to the cocktail shaker and shake. 
Dump the water and ice from the coupe glass. 
Double strain into the glass. 
Garnish with a lemon twist or dehydrated lemon wheel.

,"With Cinco de Mayo right around the corner i have to make sure everyone knows how to make a classic margarita.So, It’s time to throw out the sour mix and use the right ingredients. 

5 ingredients: Lime Juice, Cointreau, Tequila, Ice, & Salt. That’s it 👏🏼 if you like your margaritas a little sweet you can add about a 1/2 oz of agave but trust me, try the classic without a sweetener first. 

Once you know the classic you can start adding fun stuff like coconut milk, pineapple juice, or jalapeños!

Remember, make it right the first time so you know what good tastes like. 

2 oz Tequila
1 oz Lime Juice
3/4 oz Cointreau
Ice
Salt, or Tajin
Garnish: lime wheels

Add tequila, lime juice (it must be fresh!!), and Cointreau into a shaker with ice. 
Shake for 30 seconds. 
Using a lime wedge rim glass with lime juice and rim in salt or Tajin. 
Double strain into a glass & garnish!

,"When it comes to glassware, there is so much out there. But I’ve always found that some of my favorite pieces are the ones that have been thrifted. So, the spirit of earth day I thought I should highlight @shopkitchensforgood 

This cute little store recently opened in my neighborhood and I went in and learned about what they are doing. Not only is this a shop with an unbelievable glassware selection but they are also a place where you can donate your used kitchen goods!

To go back even further, @kitchensforgood is a non profit that focuses on, “Culinary Apprenticeship Program that would provide workforce training to individuals hardest hit by unemployment and food insecurity.” Truly a place that im so glad I found & will be donating my many glasses to!!

If you’re local to San Diego check it out! If you’re not local, here’s a reminder to find your local thrift stores, thrift glassware, and donate your own goods when you’re ready to part with them. 

Happy earth day everyone!

,"Tequila tuesdays??? Let’s make a Citrus Tequila Spritz 

This one is a simple one (can be made into an easy mocktail too) The key to this recipe, and let’s be real to EVERY recipe, is the importance of freshly squeezed citrus. A perfect way to use up your citrus if it’s on the outs is to make this drink!

1.5 oz Tequíla
3/4 oz Grapefruit Juice
1/2 oz Lime Juice
3/4 oz Orange Juice
1/2 oz Simple Syrup
8-10 drops @disco__inferno__ 🔥 (or you can use a jalapeño simple syrup to sub for these drops instead of regular syrup)
Soda Water or sparkling water (I used @zevia lemon lime twist)
Ice
Garnish: citrus wheel & edible flowers

In a cocktail shaker add all citrus, tequila, syrup and drops. 
Add ice and shake. 
Double strain (or single strain it’s really up to you) into a highball glass with ice.

,"Edible flowers 101

There are a lot of edible flowers out there, it’s hard to list them all but here are some of the most popular ones:
Marigolds
Viola’s 
Nasturtium
Pansy flowers
Chamomile
Dahlia
Roses
Hibiscus
Micro orchid
Verbena
Orchid

Now where can you get them?
Most grocery stores sell them and you can find them in the Refrigerated section near the mint or rosemary (the herbs that are already packaged) but check first for brands like:
@jacobsfarmdelcabo 
@freshoriginsmicrogreens 
@melissasproduce 

I go to my local restaurant supply store @specialtyproduce for mine with a huge selection so finding a your local supply store might be a safe bet.

If you can’t edible flowers in your area, plant them yourself! Almost every plant store will have edible flowers.

Have questions? Let me know!

,"Monthly Join Jules cocktail: Mezcal Aperol Sour 

It’s hard to pick one favorite cocktail. I love Mezcal cocktails, Aperol Spritz, Egg White cocktails & Pineapple juice. So I decided to put them all together to make this beauty. After tasting I still think it needs a zinger like Chile liqueur or even green chartreuse but this cocktail is overall a perfect cocktail to try this month. 

Ingredients:
1/2 oz Agave
3/4 oz Lime Juice
1 oz Pineapple Juice
3/4 oz Cointreau
1 oz Aperol
2 oz Mezcal
1 Egg White
Ice
Garnish: edible flowers & citrus wheel

Add all ingredients into a cocktail shaker and shake without ice. 
Add ice and shake again. 
Double strain into a coupe glass and garnish. 

Xoxo, cheers from yours truly

,"Two things happening here:

Flower ice cubes
The best lemonade inspired cocktail I’ve ever made

Let’s start with the ice cubes. These clear flower cubes will transform any drink. They are perfection. I recommend getting a clear ice cube maker tray to make these. (I have a whole Amazon section linked in my bio)

Now the cocktail: simplicity at its finest. 

1 oz Limonecello
3/4 oz Elderflower liqueur (@stgermaindrinks )
1/2 oz Fresh Lemon Juice
Tonic Water (@fevertreemixers )

Add these ingredients into a glass with ice and top with tonic. 
It’s that simple and easy. 

brb going to make another one it’s so good.

,"Starting your at home bar or bar cart? You know you’ll want to have your favorite: Tequila (Blanco & reposado), Vodka, Gin, whiskey or bourbon, and Rum (white rum and dark rum) but you’ll also want specialty liqueurs. Not all liqueurs are the same so here are some of my favorites I always have stocked in my home bar

Coffee Liqueur:
Espresso Martini’s 
White Russians
You could even make a coffee old fashioned
Coffee liqueur is a must have for coffee lovers like myself
If you love sweet, dessert or coffee types of cocktails than adding coffee liqueur to your recipes is a must try!

Orange Liqueur
Orange liqueur is that bottle that everyone should have in their bar. It’s used in so many different cocktail recipes and one of the most popular recipes a Margarita
You’ll use orange liqueur in a margarita, a sidecar cocktail and even a mai tai

You can buy: Cointreau, Grand mariner, orange curaçao but do note that some are different than others and a great starting point is cointreau or triple sec. 

Aperol and Campari
Whether you’re a spritzer or a Negroni, I think it’s necessary to have both. Aperol is used in classic cocktails like the Aperol spritz, Paper plane, or even an Aperol tonic!
Campari is also one of those must haves: used in my favorite, the Negroni, a Jungle bird, or even a simple Garibaldi cocktail. You can find so many recipes using both of these liqueurs I recommend you get them!

Chile Liqueur
This is one of my favorite ways to literally spice up a drink. Spice up a margarita or even a classic gin sour recipe. Now Chile liqueur is a fun one for me, as I like spice to my cocktails but you can also get a st. Germain or chambord liqueur really whatever your preference is in taste. I just recommend you get a fun flavored liqueur that you can play with. 

Again - personal preference but I think you should stalk your bar with green chartreuse and maraschino liqueur for the last word or last of the Oaxacans. But I love using both in recipes and playing with them

On that note, looks like I’m off to get more green chartreuse! Comment your questions below

One thing to note too, I recommend having a Sweet and Dry vermouth! That’s a staple too

,"Honey Lemon & Basil Shaken Espresso Spritz, trust me on this one. 

While traveling to Mexico we got these lemonade espresso spritz coffees and they were so delicious and reminded me of a warm and sunny spring day! So, i wanted to recreate it with local honey, fresh Basil and of course fresh lemon juice!

& for those asking for an update on the new Espresso Machine: I’m in love. It is taking me a minute to get the perfect espresso pull but practice makes perfect & I’m keeping the handbook very close for now lol

In a mason jar add 1 tsp honey, 1/2 lemon juiced, and espresso. 
Add ice and shake. 
In a tall glass add tonic water & top with the shaken espresso. 
Garnish with fresh Basil or a lemon wedge.
