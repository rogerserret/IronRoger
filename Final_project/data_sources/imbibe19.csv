2019-01,"January 14, 2019,While looking for a cocktail to match the cuisine at Pammy’s in Cambridge, bar manager Rich Andreoli turned to Giuseppe Gonzalez’s Infante, a combination of tequila, orgeat, lime and orange blossom water.

Bring the mixture to a simmer, then remove from the heat. Place in a sealable container overnight to steep. The next day, strain the mixture through a cheese cloth-lined chinois.
