0,2020-01,"The Apple Martini, a.k.a. Appletini, received attention as the cosmopolitan drink of today’s woman, thanks toSex & The City.Sure, that was nice for the ladies, but it deserved more. I was determined to, a) come up with a recipe that both men and women would like, b) capture it’s real appeal as a great fall drink, and c) erase any memory of the name, Appletini, or its inference as a sugary sweet girl’s drink.  The recipe that literally took me longer than a year to come up with used Three Olives Sour Apple Vodka, which people loved.  Then Three Olives discontinued it in favor of cotton candy vodka (no comment).  Over the next ten years, I periodically tried to re-create the same flavor and intensity with different vodkas and variations.  Finally, I’ve come up with this almost identical one to the Three Olives experience:,Requirements:  Smirnoff Green Apple Vodka, standard vodka, apple schnapps, Cointreau, lemon juice.,Combine all ingredients in an ice-filled shaker.  Shake vigorously for 10-15 seconds until condensation forms on the shaker’s outside.  Strain into a cold martini glass.  An apple wedge may or may not be used as a garnish.,Comment:  Like the Cosmo, the fruitiness of the apple martini is a great combo with a fish or seafood dinner. It also suits the mood of fall’s apple-picking and apple pie season.  It’s refreshing outdoors in the summer too, especially when shaken to a frosty consistency.,November 27, 2021,January 23, 2021,December 7, 2019,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

1,2022-01,"If you’ve got a good bottle of London dry gin, theBOOMERANGreturns an expanded and more flavorful variation of agin martini.  It’s really just a couple of adjustments:  Proportions are slightly different and it adds maraschino liqueur (or juice from the maraschino cherry jar) to the mix.  When going for a martini, this gin variation is one to remember.,Required:Dry gin, dry vermouth, maraschino liqueur (juice), Angostura bitters, Lemon peel,Combine all liquid ingredients into an ice-filled shaker.  Shake vigorously and strain into a cocktail glass.  Garnish with a lemon twist or peel and serve straight up.,Comments:The “boomerang” effect, according to the Oxford dictionary, can describe any action that returns to the originator, often with negative consequences.  In the case of theBoomerangcocktail, it feels as though the karma has been good and positive consequences have come around.  It’s return invites you to kick back at home and put your feet up.  It’s sometimes served with rye whiskey, or sometimes it resembles aBronxcocktail;  but this recipe is neither.

Combine all liquid ingredients into an ice-filled shaker. Shake vigorously and strain into a martini glass.,Comments:Pictured above is Bailey’s Irish Cream, which substituted just fine for creme de cacao; though I’m sure the creme de cacao would have made it even better and been more loyal to the theme. If one prefers to make this less a desert and more a cocktail, use 1.5 oz. vanilla vodka instead of .75 oz. A nice touch which I remember from a Hershey Park restaurant is to crush a Hershey’s Kiss or piece of dark chocolate and sprinkle on top of the drink before serving.

3,2020-10,"DIRTY MARTINI(vodka) – Olive lovers enjoy splashing olive juice or brine into the martini mix, making the vodka “dirty”. If you’re on calorie watch, it adds only about 25 calories more to a dry vodka martini’s 125 calories. The ratio of olive juice to vodka depends on the individual’s taste.  My recommendation for a smooth balance is detailed below:,Requirements:Vodka, extra dry vermouth, olive juice or brine from jar, cocktail olives.,Line the inside of a shaker with extra dry vermouth by shaking vermouth with ice and pouring out both ice and vermouth. Refill shaker with clean ice and add vodka and olive juice. Shake vigorously until the shaker’s outside forms condensation. Pour into a martini glass and serve “up.” Garnish with 2-3 olives on a skewer.,Comments:Like the classic martini, use your best vodka. Unlike sugary fruit juices which can sometimes hide a “cheap” liquor, olive juice accents your existing vodka. My recipe calls for just a hint of vermouth, but some prefer no vermouth.  Others like up to .50 oz. vermouth.  Although the Dirty Martini is wonderful for any time or occasion, I particularly like it before a meal to clean the palate.  Also, for gin lovers, just replace the vodka recipe with dry gin for a dirty gin martini.,Tags:cocktailsdirtymartinidryvermouthketelonemartinirossoolivecocktailsolivejuicerussianstandardvodkatitosvodkavermouthvodkavodkacocktailsvodkadrinks,July 18, 2020,June 9, 2020,July 15, 2020,By way of introduction, I am Mark Schaefer with Nutritional Products International (nutricompany.com).

4,2020-05,"TheGINGER COSMO MARTINI is a light, refreshing version of aCosmo, with the additional  ginger flavoring.  The offset of Cointreau with ginger is an interesting combination.  The math of the two would be 1+1=3, in that its aftertaste is very summery and at times more like grapefruit than ginger. There are a few recipes for this drink floating around; but this is the simplest and best if you’ve either made ginger vodka yourself (see my 5/9/20 post about ginger-infused vodka) or purchased ginger vodka.

5,2020-07,"ThePOMEGRANATE MARTINIis similar to a Cosmo, but more complex and probably stronger, while still going down easy — at least by this recipe. It’s had a wide appeal in my little circle of imbibers, even more-so than the Cosmo. Basically, the sweetness of pomegranate, orange liquor and citron vodka are stretched out by adding regular vodka (very unorthodox) and fresh lime juice for tartness. Yes, pomegranate juice has its share of sugar, but it’s also rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals and bioactive plant compounds that I convince myself has to count for something. The pomegranate martini might be a step or two more in the making than a Cosmo, but in my opinion, has more interesting layers.,Requirements:Vodka, Citron Vodka, Cointreau, pomegranate juice and fresh lime juice.,For a single serving, 1 part equals 3/4 oz. or one pony. For serving two, 1 part equals a 1.5 oz. jigger in place of the pony.,Pour all liquid ingredients into a cocktail shaker filled with ice. Shake vigorously for 10-15 seconds. Strain into a cold martini glass. Garnish with a lime slice or 2-3 pimento cocktail olives (see video demo above).,Comment:I had never garnished pomegranate martinis with anything. If using any garnish, the natural one would seem to be a lime wedge. But a friend insisted on green cocktail olives with her pomegranate martini and my wife and I found this to be an excellent combo. The saltiness of the olive is a good offset to the pomegranate, sort of like the friendliness of salt to chocolate.,Celebrities who prefer the Pomegranate Martini:Madonna, Charlize Theron,Tags:absolutevodkacocktailscointreaucosmojuiceketelonelimepomegranatepomegranatemartinirussianstandardtitosvodka,July 8, 2020,March 3, 2020,January 30, 2020,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

6,2022-04,"Before they drop, or before the next sudden wind squall blows them to smithereens, pick a few cherry blossoms off the tree to garnish aSAKURA MARTINI.  It’s a great way to celebrate spring’s cherry blossom season.  The Sakura Martini combines Japanese sake with dry gin and in so doing creates a softer martini than the standard gin & vermouth.  It was created by NYC’s bartender andBar Gotoowner, Kenta Goto.

In spare quantities, the Scotch whisky’s smoky notes blend beautifully with the gin’s botanicals. It’s an easy, no frills martini that should always show off your best gin and best Scotch.  Little touches, such as chilling the glass and twisting the lemon peel over the drink, make a difference.,Requirements:Gin (London dry gin preferred), blended or single-malt scotch, lemon peel,Combine the gin and Scotch in an ice-filled mixing glass and stir until well chilled.

I enjoyed it using Hendrick’s.  You can experiment with the Scotch by trying a blend like Dewar’s or a smoky single malt Scotch like Laphroaig.

Squeeze a lemon twist over the drink and then drop into the mix.,Comment:I find the lemon twist to be an equal player in this cocktail and short of adding lemon juice, should always be included.

10,2019-12,"TheVODKA MARTINIis a standard that displaced the traditional gin martini. It was made more famous in the sixties of course by Ian Fleming’s James Bond — “shaken, not stirred.”  It’s simple to make, but delicate to the drinker’s taste.  Most are customized to the customer’s vodka choice and amount of dry vermouth used.  “Extra dry” is usually a request for just a hint of vermouth via a splash, while no extra dry request might mean 3/4 oz of dry vermouth (1 pony) per 3 oz. vodka (2 jiggers).,Required:  Vodka, extra dry vermouth, green pimento martini olives,Fill a shaker with ice.  Pour 3/4 oz. dry vermouth into shaker.  Shake it in order to thoroughly distribute the shaker with vermouth.

13,2020-07,"Cachaca is to Brazil’sCAIPIRINHA,as Tequila is to Mexico’sMargarita;though theCaipirinhais less Americanized as theMargarita.TheCaipirinha’sbasic recipe is very simple but requires that you muddle sugar onto crushed quarters of lime before adding cachaca. When prepared properly, it’s one of the most refreshing of cocktails. For that reason and its ease of preparation, every household would benefit by having a bottle of cachaca on hand.,Requirements:Cachaca, fresh lime, sugar, muddler.,Cut half lime into 4 quarters. Cut away white skin from lime to avoid bitterness. Put lime quarters into glass along with 2 teaspoons of sugar and crush with muddler, 14-15 times. Add cachaca. Add either small ice cubes or crushed ice. Stir well and garnish glass with lime wheel or wedge.,The facts about Cachaca:Cachaca is fermented and distilled from sugar cane, though not from the molasses side-product that rum requires. Cachaca is distinctly Brazilian because it is aged in Brazilian hardwoods; rum is aged in bourbon barrels constructed from American oak and can be made anywhere.,Comment:There are a couple of tips given by Brazilian friends. First, using good Cachaca is key. I’ve been presented with two excellent bottles of cachaca which I list below. Second, it’s been suggested that the white skin on a lime can create a bitterness to the drink, so it’s recommended that it be cut away before adding to the glass.

Some people might choose single malt scotch or even bourbon.  The almond-flavored amaretto softens the whisky, but at the lower proportion doesn’t mask it.  And vice-versa, the scotch softens the amaretto liqueur.  Though some recipes for this cocktail call for equal parts of each ingredient, this one tones down the sweetness and merely accents the whisky with liqueur.,Requirements:whisky (blended scotch preferred), amaretto,Combine both ingredients into an ice-filled cocktail glass and stir.

Actually, the crushed ice doesn’t dilute the whisky’s flavor…unless you drink it 3 hours later. The whisky’s underlying taste will seem more vibrant than if you were to gulp it down straight.  But where crushed ice awaits, you should use a full-bodied 12-year Scotch from the Highlands so that it’s a beautiful mist that envelopes you in fragrant layers of flavor, not a watered-down fog more suited to an amusement park thirst-quencher. The same holds true for using a quality aged bourbon, rye or rum.,Requirements:12+year Scotch, lemon peel, crushed ice,Fill an old-fashioned glass with crushed ice and pour in Scotch.

21,2020-02,"I didn’t understand the point of theSCOTCH & SODAuntil I watched a bartender serve it.  First, he filled a tall, narrow-mouthed highball glass with ice and walked away. A minute later he reported back to swirl the ice for several seconds before pouring it out. He refilled it halfway with fresh ice before pouring single-malt Glenlivet scotch into 1/3 of the glass. He placed it before the businessman at the bar and filled the rest of the glass with club soda. The man nodded okay to the lemon peel garnish.  It was elegant without being self-indulgent, classy without being fussy.  Simple and whisky-delicious.  As I found out later, with the right soda the scotch flavor is still there to enjoy, but easier on the constitution.  It would also seem to be the right kind of cocktail for this particular customer who was having a business-type conversation with the gentleman sitting next to him.,Requirements:Scotch, soda, lemon or orange peel (optional),Chill or freeze a highball glass.  Fill halfway or more with ice and pour scotch.  Tilt glass at an angle and pour 4-5 oz. club soda slowly.  Garnish with lemon or orange peel (optional).,Comments:I’m not sure I’d waste an aged single-malt scotch on a Scotch & Soda, although it’s legal.  The blended scotch whiskies are usually recommended:  Dewar’s, Johnnie Walker Black, or Cutty Sark.  The little 10 oz. bottles of club soda are great for a good fizz.  The most recommended club soda isFever-Tree.  The amount of club soda used is by individual taste; the common serving is 4-5 oz. Garnishing is optional, but serving the Scotch & Soda in a tall thin (highball) glass is a must to preserve the bubbles.

Stir well and garnish glass with lime wheel or wedge.,The facts about Cachaca:Cachaca is fermented and distilled from sugar cane, though not from the molasses side-product that rum requires.

I’ve been presented with two excellent bottles of cachaca which I list below. Second, the white skin on a lime can create a bitterness to the drink, so it’s recommended that it be cut away before adding to the glass.

Heat at a light simmer until all the sugar dissolves, then cool before using.  The syrup has notes of molasses and toffee which will also pair well with dark spirits like bourbon and brandy; so bottle it and hang on to it.,Special Notes:Just as Cubans are known for their excellent hand-rolled cigars, it’s recommended here that the limes are rolled before juicing and then squeezed by hand, versus a juicer.

The glass may be garnished with a lime slice or not.,Reminder:  1.5 oz. equals 1 jigger;  3/4 oz. equals 1 pony.,Comments:  Obviously, rimming the glass with salt is optional.,Simpler is better, but allowing this basic recipe to “hydrate” on rocks for five minutes helps make it smoother from the start.  Also, smaller ice cubes work better than larger cubes in a Margarita.,Prove me wrong, but I’m convinced you can judge the quality of a Mexican restaurant by its Margarita.  If the bartender adds a (1) “sweet & sour” mix to a (2) “house” tequila and (3) Triple Sec liqueur — most of the time I’d be better off going somewhere else to eat and drink.,December 20, 2019,December 18, 2021,February 20, 2021,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

27,2021-09,"The MOJITO is an iconic Cuban cocktail that emerged from a Havana bar around 1910. It’s a bartender’s least favorite concoction to make in a bar, not because it requires many types of liquor, but because it’s time-consuming to prepare properly. So avoid ordering these from the bartender and make them at home, where you can also be sure that your mint is fresh. The video tutorial link above shows the steps.,Requirements:8-10 mint leaves, mint sprig, simple syrup, white rum, lime juice, seltzer/club soda,In a Collins glass, gently muddle the mint leaves with simple syrup. Add white rum, lime juice and seltzer (or club soda). Fill glass halfway with crushed ice and stir. Top the glass with more crushed ice and gently incorporate with a quick stir. Garnish with a mint sprig. Place straw between the mint sprig leaves.,Particulars:Place the mint leaves in the palm of your hand and slap them hard with the other to open the mint oils before placing the sprig leaves garnish in the glass. Some like to top the glass, after filled with crushed ice, with a bit more seltzer or even sometimes more rum (3/4 oz.). Many disagree with the addition of any seltzer or club soda at all. Cuban Mojitos use sugar instead of simple syrup. Some methods suggest shaking (pre-seltzer), not stirring. Others like to muddle quarter cuts of lime with mint at the base of the Collins glass and leave the lime inside the drink, much like a caipirinha.  You can pick and choose your favorite preparation method.,History:  The Mojito evolved from an earlier 16th-century drink similar to a Caipirinha which was used to settle the stomach of the Englishman Sir Francis Drake, who was a “privateer” (pirate) and later switched out the cachaca for rum.,Favorite Drink Of:Ernest Hemingway,Tags:bacardiclearrumclubsodacubancocktailscubandrinksernesthemingwayhavanahavanacocktailshavanadrinkslimelimejuicemintmintleavesmojitorumsilverrumsimplesyrupsletzer,January 16, 2020,April 12, 2022,December 26, 2019,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

28,2021-08,"We salute and toast the dedication and accomplishments of all athletes who made the Olympic journey to Tokyo, 2021. A nice Japanese drink to toast them is theSHOCHU MELON CITRUScocktail.  The Japanese liquor, shochu (detailed below), is extremely popular in Japan, but not as well known internationally as its sake. Shochu’s clean and mild flavor is similar to vodka in allowing many elaborations and opportunities for cocktails. Here’s one that can be fine-tuned to suit your taste:,Requirements:Shochu, melon liqueur (Midora preferred), club soda or seltzer (optional) fresh lemon juice, cherry and/or orange slice,Add all ingredients except club soda to an ice-filled shaker.  Shake well and strain into an ice-filled glass.  A dash (1.5 oz.) of club soda or seltzer may be added.  Stir gently.  Garnish with a maraschino cherry and/or orange slice.,Shochu:In Japan, shochu is actually more popular than sake and is different in several ways.  Shochu is distilled; sake is fermented.  Shochu is made from either barley, sweet potato or rice; sake is made only from rice.  Shochu is stronger at 25-30% alcohol; sake is 15-18% alcohol.  Good quality shochu – Honkaku Shochu, or classic shochu – issingledistilled, so it retains the characters of the base ingredient. A sweet potato shochu is very different from a rice shochu.  Because of the variations in flavor, not all shochu works in every shochu cocktail.,Comments:I like adding the dash of club soda or seltzer to this drink.  With two garnishes added, it becomes multi-dimensional in flavor. I used a roasted barley-derived Honkaku Shochu which gave it a slight nutty/sesame flavor. There is other popular shochu derived from rice & sweet potato, which I can’t yet speak for.  Bottles of shochu at my nearby NYC wine & liquor store ranged from $21-55.,Tags:clubsodacocktailcocktailshonkakuhonkakushochujapanesecocktailskintarolemonjuicemelonliqueurmidoriliqueurmidorimelonliqueurolympiccocktailsolympicdrinksolympicsolympictoastssakeseltzershochushochumelon citrusshochumeloncocktail,December 31, 2019,October 11, 2020,January 10, 2020,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

29,2021-06,"Applejackevolved from American apple brandy back in the 1600’s [SeeHistory]. It’s as American as apple pie and is underrated as a cocktail mixer. Many mixologists and bartenders in the know agree that Applejack is a better mixer than so-called prestigious European apple brandies. Two such Applejack recipes are known simply asAPPLEJACK NO. 1andAPPLEJACK NO. 2.  Both are equally delicious.  Your choice of the two depends upon whether you prefer sweetening with Demerara Syrup (simple syrup can also be used) or with sweet vermouth.,Applejack No. 1,Shake ingredients in an ice-filled shaker.  Strain into a rocks glass filled with ice.,Applejack No. 2,Substitute sweet vermouth (1/2 oz.) for the syrup sweetener used in Applejack No. 1.  Shake and strain into an ice-filled rocks glass.,History:The American colonists increased hard cider’s alcohol content by leaving barrels outside overnight to freeze, a method known as “jacking,”  which allowed drinkers to separate the higher-proof alcohol.   “Applejack” became the product of Scotsman and distiller  William Laird (1698)  in New Jersey and was such a favorite of George Washington that Laird shared the recipe with Washington, who shared Applejack with the state of Virginia.  Today, Laird’s Applejack is a pure spirit beverage made from a blend of apple brandy and neutral grain spirits.  Federal guidelines for Applejack require that it be a blend of at least 20% apple distillate with neutral grain spirit and aged at least two years in oak.,Comment:As America’s oldest spirit (before bourbon), an Applejack cocktail is a great way to celebrate Thanksgiving and Independence Day.,Tags:applebrandyapplejackbrandycocktailcocktail&sonscocktailsdemerarasyrupgeorgewashingtonlairdlaird&companyregansorangebitterssimplesyrupwhiskey,February 6, 2020,March 1, 2022,July 31, 2021,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

30,2020-02,"TheBETWEEN THE SHEETScocktail was short-changed from the start by giving it a cheap romance-novel name.  Let’s face it, who’s going to yell to a bartender across mixed company a drink request with this long, provacative name? For short, let’s call it a BTS, with a nod to the Korean pop band.  This under-appreciated cocktail indeed dances into your heart, or at least your palate, by basically adding rum to the Sidecar cocktail.  So it starts good, and ends up great.  (Maybe the drink order at dinner could go something like, “I’ll have a BTS, shaken, not stirred, up, with a twist.”),Requirements:Brandy or cognac, light rum, Cointreau, simple syrup, lemon juice, orange peel,Mix all liquid ingredients in an ice-filled shaker.  Shake vigorously and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.  Squeeze an orange peel over the drink and add as garnish.  Serve “up”.,Comment:This is one ounce of liquor more than a Sidecar; so it’s strong.  But it’s a well-rounded, smooth cocktail.  It doesn’t require the sugar on the cocktail glass rim like the Sidecar and is easy to make.  I prefer E&J brandy and Bicardi rum with the Cointreau. I’ve added a link below to a bartender’s instructional demo (although he suggests aged dark rum while most others specifically say light clear rum).,History:Created supposedly at Harry’s New York bar in Paris during Prohibition, 1930’s.,July 18, 2020,August 29, 2020,November 15, 2020,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

31,2021-04,"ABRANDY SOURis a an ages-old alternative to the standardWhiskey Sourfor those not fond of whiskey, or for those who seek the fruitier zest of brandy.  Since brandy is produced by distilling wine or fermenting fruit juices versus whiskey’s distillation of grain mash (corn, rye, barley, wheat, etc.), brandy brings a sometimes sweeter blend to the Sour than whiskey.  Proportions have changed many times over the years. The balance that I prefer is in the following recipe:,Requirements:Brandy or cognac, fresh lemon juice, Angostura bitters, simple syrup,Combine liquid ingredients in an ice-filled shaker.  Shake to blend and chill, then strain into an ice-filled glass.  Garnish with a lemon wheel and maraschino cherry.,Alternative RecipeThere have been variations of the Brandy Sour over the last 170 years, sometimes with egg whites, sometimes with powdered sugar, but usually with fresh lemon juice.  An equally fine version carries more of an orange-flavored theme.

It also depends on your preference for tasting the whiskey neat or whether you want to stay closer to a softened whiskey-rocks.,Tags:elijahcraigbourbonfourrosesmakersmarkold-fashionedoldfashionedwhiskeywhiskeycocktailswhiskeydrinkswhiskywhiskydrinkswoodfordreserve,July 1, 2020,May 25, 2022,June 9, 2020,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

40,2020-10,"In welcoming back the Big 10 to U.S. college football, I tried to come up with a 10-ingredient cocktail (yes, even though the Big 10 has 14 teams).  The best I could come up with required nine — ten, if you include the coupe/martini glass.  I wanted to revisit the QUARANTINE anyway and was surprised I liked it so much.  Aside from separating egg-white to mix into the drink, it really only takes ten minutes to prepare.  And what better drink for our times?  It expands a dry gin martini into a rum punch concoction with a hint of licorice.

Garnish with a lemon twist.,HISTORY:When the U.S. military moved into the harbor of Manila in 1898, there was already a liquor culture present. The Philippines likely introduced distillation to Mexico and their trade route with Acapulco made them instrumental in the development of tequila.  The U.S. made Philippines an American territory in 1899 and the military was then dispatched to keep it that way.  Where Americans went, a thirst for cocktails quickly followed.,In 1926, an American writer and drink-lover, Charles H. Baker, arrived in the American-controlled Philippines and witnessed how cocktails had adapted to local conditions.  In compiling a list of 17 Filipino cocktail creations, one drink in particular was more popular than the perennial dry martini and a number one favorite:  theQUARANTINE.  The recipe came from the manager of the Manila Hotel, “Monk” Antrim.,Tags:anisecocktailsginpernodquarantine_cocktailquarantinecocktailrumrum bacardirumwhiterum,October 23, 2021,June 19, 2021,March 3, 2020,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

41,2021-10,"Despite its name,SATAN’S WHISKERSis anything but the drink from hell.  It’s an orange-flavored gin martini dating back to the 1930’s and credited to Harry Craddock, as published in theSavoy Cocktail Book.  It’s “perfect” in being equal parts gin, sweet vermouth, dry vermouth and orange juice.  The addition of Grand Marnier is considered the “straight” version; otherwise orange curacao can be added and it’s the “curled” version.  The proportions for the Straight Satan’s Whiskers are:,Add the liquid ingredients to an ice-filled shaker.  Shake and strain into a chilled coup or cocktail glass.  Garnish with an orange twist.,Comment:The mix of flavors in theSatan’s Whiskersresults in a complex blend of sweet, bitter & citrusy orange layers.  The Bronx cocktail is a similar combination but adds more gin.  Some recipes call for 2/3 ounces (20 mil.) in the gin/vermouth/O.J. combo and 1/3 oz. (10 ml.) Grand Marnier. The curled version calls for up to six dashes orange bitters.,Forgotten Cocktail:Satan’s Whiskershas an old world flavor to savor in each sip. It should emerge from its orange Halloween glow and land on every bar cocktail menu. This drink is old and has probably been through many subtle changes over the years.

In a mixing glass, stir together bitters with sugar (or simple syrup) and a lemon peel.  Add rye whisky, fill with ice and stir until well chilled.

43,2020-01,"The Scofflaw Cocktail was created in 1924 Paris during Prohibition.  The word is a noun used to describe a person who drinks illegally, a combination of the words “scoff” and “law”.  If the Scofflaw had a cousin, it might be the Manhattan, because it also uses rye whiskey (or bourbon) and vermouth, but substitues Grenadine for the Manhattan’s maraschino cherries.  It departs the Manhattan also in using dry vermouth versus sweet vermouth and orange bitters instead of Angostura bitters.  It adds lime juice, or some prefer lemon juice.,Required:  Bourbon (or rye whiskey), dry vermouth, lime juice, orange bitters,Fill a shaker with ice and add all ingredients.  Shake well and strain into a chilled cocktail or martini glass.  Garnish with an orange peel.,Comment:  Anytime Grenadine is required, you risk over-sweetening a drink.  I usually start on the lower end — in this case about 1/2 ounce — and taste first.  It’s easy to add a couple more drops if needed.  I also learned the hard way that one should NEVER pour Grenadine directly from the bottle, but into a measuring utensil like a jigger or pony.,April 22, 2022,September 2, 2020,September 12, 2020,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

45,2022-02,"Out of 1898 Boston comesWARD EIGHT, an elaboration of the Whiskey Sour using rye whiskey, lemon juice, orange juice and grenadine.  It’s  wonderfully flavorful and intriguing, enough so that it deserves a revival.  It’s also a good small-group drink to have on hand for get-togethers and Super Bowl parties. Although the Ward Eight adds orange juice and grenadine to the Sour, the complexity and balance makes this a winner over the more popular Whiskey Sour.,REQUIREMENTS:rye whiskey, lemon juice, orange juice, grenadine, cocktail cherry and/or orange wedge for garnish,Add liquid ingredients to an ice-filled shaker.  Shake vigorously and strain into a coup glass.  Garnish with a cocktail cherry and/or an orange wedge.,COMMENTS:Rye whiskies recommended for the Ward Eight are:  Bulleit, Woodford Reserve, Knob Creek, Crown Royal and Sazerac.  The grenadine measurement can go up to two teaspoons if you like it sweeter. If you want to switch out the rye for bourbon, that’s perfectly fine too, and stay with the lesser grenadine.,PARTY COCKTAIL:  This is a good small-group cocktail (4-8) which can be measured by multiplying the amounts above by the number of drinks.  One tip:  Measure out the mix into an ice-less container that can hold all the mix (8-12 oz.). When ready, pour just enough of the mix into an ice-filled shaker to serve. For Super Bowl Sunday, have the garnishes and glassware ready and you’re all set.,HISTORY:Named after a Boston election district in 1898, Ward #8 helped win the election for political czarMartin M. Lomasneyto the state’s legislature. The cocktail was created to honor his election.

48,2020-06,"TheBLACK & TANis a beer mix that layers a dark stout or porter over a lager or pale ale. It is classically made with Guinness Stout and Bass Ale, but can be substituted with other beers as long as the density of the lager/ale is heavy enough to withstand the usually lighter weight and density of the stout/porter. In Ireland, it’s more appropriate to call this aHalf & Half, since “black & tan” originally referred to the uniforms of the often-cruel British paramilitary forces formed to suppress the Irish independence movement in 1920 and 1921.,Requirements:Lager (or pale ale) beer, stout (or porter) beer,Recipe for a pint (16-ounce) glass:,Pour 8 oz. of lager (or pale ale) into a chilled pint glass, leaving about 1/4 inch of foam at its top.  Slowly pour 8 oz. of stout (or porter) over the lager using the back of a spoon or other contraption to distribute it.  Maintain the stout’s “flooring” just above the lager to create a distinct separation between the two beers.,The Separation:You have to block and disperse the stout’s pour gently in order to prevent the two beers from mixing.  Having a specialBlack & Tanspoon or strainer (as in the video above) helps.  You have to experiment with beers used:  Some lagers and ales are less heavy than Bass Ale and some stouts and porters are heavier than Guinness, and you’ll notice the two might mix during the pour.  I’ve found it helpful to put both pre-refrigerated beers in a freezer for ten minutes before pouring.  Make sure the lager has a quarter-inch head on it when poured.,Recommended Combinations:Guinness & Bass Ale, Guinness & Harp Lager (“Half and Half”), Murphy’s & Redhook (“Snapper”), Guinness & Champagne (“Black Velvet”), Guinness & Hard Cider (“Snakebite”), Guinness & Sam Adams Lager (“Patriot”), or Beamish & Abita Amber Lager (“Big Easy”).,Comment:The special thing about theBlack & Tanis its ability to maintain the unique individuality of each beer while creating a beautiful whole — a nice social metaphor for our times.

A minute later he reported back to swirl the ice for several seconds before pouring it out. He refilled it halfway with fresh ice before pouring single-malt Glenlivet scotch into 1/3 of the glass. He placed it before the businessman at the bar and filled the rest of the glass with club soda. The man nodded okay to the lemon peel garnish.  It was elegant without being self-indulgent, classy without being fussy.  Simple and whisky-delicious.  As I found out later, with the right soda the scotch flavor is still there to enjoy, but easier on the constitution.  It would also seem to be the right kind of cocktail for this particular customer who was having a business-type conversation with the gentleman sitting next to him.,Requirements:Scotch, soda, lemon or orange peel (optional),Chill or freeze a highball glass.

Garnishing is optional, but serving the Scotch & Soda in a tall thin (highball) glass is a must to preserve the bubbles. My odd personal preference is to garnish with an orange peel and add a dash of orange bitters.,March 20, 2020,February 6, 2020,May 18, 2022,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

Prepare it a few days in advance with a lemon peel, refrigerate, and your work is done when the occasion arrives.,Requirements:1.5 cups vodka, 1/3 cup sliced ginger (4-5 inches), lemon peel, 1 pint jar with lid,Peel 4-5 inches of a fresh ginger root using a spoon.  Wash and slice the ginger into quarter-inch pieces and put into a 1-pint jar container.  Add 1.5 cups of voda and a lemon peel to the jar, cover, and shake.  Store the sealed container in a cool, dark place for 5 days, shaking occasionally.  After five days, pour the vodka through a strainer and discard the ginger solids.  Return the strained, infused vodka to a clean bottle or suitable container with a lid.  Store the infused vodka in the refrigerator or freezer for up to 1 month.,Notes:Don’t use “upper shelf” vodka for this.  Your ginger and lemon can just as easily create a great infused vodka with Tito’s or Absolute as it can Russian Standard Platinum or Grey Goose.,Comments:I became a fan of infused vodka in Saint Petersburg, Russia when it was served at the Hotel Astoria. Their great assortment of vodka infusions served icy cold were unbeatable.  Later, I ordered infused vodka at the original Russian Tea Room in NYC and was again impressed and felt it was a close second to the Hotel Astoria.  You can buy ginger vodka in a store, but it will never be the same quality as when you infuse it with fresh ingredients yourself.,I find that ginger vodka helps digest a heavy meal, or even stimulate your appetite for a heavy meal.

55,2021-07,"“It’s less sweet than bourbon but not as powerful and peaty as some Scotches, striking an appealing balance,” say some reviewers of Japanese whiskies.,In 2003’s filmLost In Translation, Bill Murray portrayed a middle-aged actor hired to be in a Japanese whisky commercial for Suntory, which seemed like a small-market joke back then. Now, Japan is the third-largest whisky-producing nation behind the U.K. and the United States.  U.S. sales revenue of Japanese whisky jumped from $1.5 million in 2011 to $24.7 million in 2017.  Japan’s whisky industry doesn’t have the ancient traditions that Saki has, but its production finesse and attention to quality have made it successful.  Because of its international success, the suppliers have had shortages, causing a bottle which once was $50 to rise to $150, and resulting in some scarcity in the U.S. liquor stores. Nonetheless, some who sip a Japanese whisky neat for the first time claim it’s “like standing on a mountain in Japan,” and it’s “more refined, subtle, complex.”* [See some informative & fun links below.],History,About 1923, outsiders came to Japan often carrying bottles of Scotch with them.  An entrepreneur who was born into a family of sake brewers –Masataka Taketsuru — traveled to Scotland to learn the whisky trade and henceforth learned the craft of whisky-making at the Scottish distilleries and from chemistry courses at the University of Glasgow.  He became the Godfather of Japanese whisky in the development of their whisky industry in the Scottish Style.,Best Japanese Whiskies(prices vary),Links to “Best Japanese Whiskies”:,https://www.liquor.com/best-japanese-whiskies-5078590,https://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/a27466729/best-japanese-whiskey-bottles/,*Link to TODAY SHOW’s Japanese Whisky Report, 7/27/21:,https://www.today.com/video/celebrating-japanese-whiskey-and-sake-117449285671,Tags:akashihibikijapancocktailsjapanesewhiskymarsshinshuiwainikkasinglemaltsuntorysuntorytokitokiwhiskyblendsyamazaki,May 6, 2020,May 21, 2022,January 8, 2020,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

56,2021-08,"The KAMIKAZE was designed for good-time shooters in the ’70’s & ’80’s, but became respectable as a cocktail later.  Fans of theLemonDropor theCosmoshould enjoy this limey orange-liqueur & vodka mix.  In fact, the Cosmo was created afterward as a cranberry-added Kamikaze spin-off.  What pushes the Kamikaze into respectable territory is the use of premium vodka, quality orange liqueur and fresh-squeezed lime juice.  Made well, it’s got all the refreshing qualities of a classic daiquiri, though shooters shouldn’t be ruled out.  If you want a trip down memory lane, yell, “Banzai!” just before downing it.,Requirements:Vodka, orange liqueur (prefer Cointreau or high-end Triple Sec), freshly squeezed lime juice, lime wheel for garnish,Shake ingredients in an ice-filled shaker for 10-15 seconds.  Strain into a chilled cocktail glass (or shot glasses).  Garnish the cocktail glass with a lime wheel.,Comments:The recipe above is on the “dryer” side and is recommended when using premium vodka — a vodka you would choose for a martini or straight.  For a richer and slightly sweeter cocktail, I’d recommend this mix:  1.5 oz. vodka, 1 oz. orange liqueur, .75 oz. lime juice.  Some prefer 1 oz. equal parts, all three ingredients.  You should adjust the ratio to suit your taste. The orange liqueur can be a higher-end triple sec or a good curacao.  Turn the Kamikaze into a pretty blue color by pouring blue curacao instead of triple sec/Cointreau.  The better the individual ingredients, the better the Kamikaze.,HIstory:The Kamikaze was invented on an American naval base in Japan after WWII.  The wordkamikazeis a Japanese word which means “divine wind,” referring to the typhoon which the Mongols ran into while trying to invade Japan in the 13th century.  The word was incorrectly applied by the Japanese military for its pilots and their sometimes impossible or suicidal missions. The drink probably took on its name due to its Japanese origins, it’s bold yet simple flavors and its kick.,For the sake of accuracy, the correct Japanese word to use before drinking isKanpai.,Tags:cocktailscointreaujapanesecocktailsjapanesedrinkskamikazeketelonelimejuicerussianplatinumvodkarussianstandardvodkashooterssummercocktailssummerdrinkstitosvodkatriplesecvodkavodkashots,June 27, 2021,February 15, 2020,April 21, 2021,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

Highballs are a very popular way to experience cocktails in Japan, especially whiskey. And using Matcha green tea powder in drinks is great because it adds the enjoyable earthy flavor.,Requirements:Japanese whiskey (preferably Hibiki), lemon juice, honey, matcha green tea powder, club soda or seltzer,In an ice-filled shaker, combine whiskey, lemon juice, honey syrup and matcha.  Shake vigorously and pour into a chilled, ice-filled highball glass.  Pour club soda or seltzer into the shaker, swirl around to rinse and then add to the glass.  Stir and garnish with a lemon wheel (optional).,Almond Milk option:Instead of topping the drink with club soda, replace with 3 oz. of almond milk for an exceptionally smooth matcha/whiskey cocktail.,Comments:If you enjoy the flavor of green tea (Who doesn’t love green tea ice cream?), matcha green tea is a welcome addition to the world of cocktails. Though Hibiki whiskey is recommended in theMatcha Highball, you might experiment with other whiskey blends if you don’t have Hibiki.  I usedJack Daniel’sand it worked fine. But the Hibiki whiskey uses a special bamboo charcoal filtering step and a blend of at least 10 malt and grain whiskies which have earned it awards and devotees.

62,2020-01,"The law requires that American (largely Kentucky) bourbon consist of at least 51% corn; but it can be as high as 80-90%.  The other components are rye, malted barley and wheat.  Some of the traditional bourbons consisting of corn, rye and malted barley are Knob Creek, Jim Beam and Wild Turkey.  Those with slightly higher rye components are Woodford Reserve, Basil Hayden’s, Bulleit and Eagle Rare.  Makers Mark uses wheat in the place of rye.  Jack Daniels and Buffalo Trace have more than 80% corn, although sources say that Jack Daniels is technically not a bourbon since it adds more than water for flavor to its bottles.*,Bourbon whiskey can be consumed neat, with ice, with water, with juice, or in shots.  There’s no right or wrong way.  You can put your nose into your glass for a sniff if you’re trying a new bourbon and if you don’t like its fragrance, you probably won’t like its taste.  Also, there’s no point in swirling the bourbon as you would a wine when sniffing because it just kicks up alcohol vapor and makes the whiskey harder to smell. There’s nothing wrong with having a beer nearby as a chaser, a sort of cleanser to the taste buds. **,Comments:  A nice way to drink a good bourbon is with one very large ice cube — it keeps it cold without watering it down too much.

Rumor has it that some antihistamines and Hot Toddys don’t get along.,Requirements:  Whiskey or bourbon, fresh lemon, honey, cinnamon (optional).,Heat water until boiling, then let sit while preparing drink.  Squeeze juice from 1/2 lemon into mug or heated glassware and drop in the lemon peel.  Add bourbon or blended whiskey and 1 teaspoon of honey.  (Use a tablespoon of honey to soothe a sore throat.) Pour about 4 ounces of hot water into mug and stir until honey disappears into drink.  Drop in a cinnamon stick as garnish or add a cinnamon sprinkle into drink (optional).,Comments:  I’m undecided about my whiskey preference in the Hot Toddy.  I playring-around-the-whiskey, a jigger full of choices… between bourbon, blended Scotch, Irish whiskey and Canadian whiskey.  Still, others enjoy Brandy or Rum.  Your choice.,If you are inbibing the Hot Toddy as a comfortable winter warm-up — which it excels at — I’d use less lemon and only 1 teaspoon of honey.  For a sore throat or hoarse voice, I’d make it more tart with a full half lemon and the tablespoon of honey to counteract.,October 31, 2020,September 26, 2020,December 31, 2019,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

66,2020-03,"There are options when deciding on the whiskey you use in the classicMANHATTAN.  The offerings are bourbon (my favorite), rye, or blended whiskey.  People who enjoy  Manhattans with Canadian blended whiskey usually regard anything else as too over-powering for what should be a silky-smooth drink.  I think that blended whiskey leaves the drink flat, while bourbon rounds it out and gives it fuller body.  So I’ve detailed the recipe below with bourbon.  Rye whiskey is more traditional and will present a dryer Manhattan. Regardless of your whiskey choice, a maraschino cherry is added to reward you for your decisional effort.,Requirements:Bourbon, sweet vermouth, Angostura bitters, maraschino cherry, maraschino cherry juice from jar.,Combine all ingredients in a mixing glass with ice.  Stir 10-15 seconds and strain into a martini glass.  Garnish with a maraschino cherry.,History:Some accounts say that the Manhattan was created in the 1860’s by a bartender at a Manhattan bar located near Broadway & Houston Street.  It’s been suggested that it gained real popularity at a Manhattan Club banquet in the mid 1870’s. The shift from American whiskey to Canadian whiskey occurred during prohibition (1920-33) because of Canadian whiskey’s availability.,Comment:The Manhattan is probably one of the best “repeat” or re-order cocktails out there.  They’re beautiful to the eye, smooth to the tongue, chilled & minimally cherry-delicious while calming, yet uplifting.  There seems to be no reason NOT to have more … until you’re feeling a little worse for the wear.  If only there was a healthy Manhattan that pumps you up for the next day.,Movie/TV Signature Drink:Some Like it Hot— Sugar (Marilyn Monroe), Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) mix up aManhattanin a hot water bottle on a train.,March 17, 2020,February 12, 2022,March 5, 2021,How about a New York Whiskey Sour?,Hey Ginny!

It’s self-created, self-named and is offered to the home bartender as aManhattansubstitute when preparation-time is short or good sweet vermouth is not available.  Aperol replaces the sweet vermouth and bitters which comprise a traditionalManhattan, allowing the preparer to mix aManhattan-like cocktail in less time with just two easily-measured ingredients.,Aperol is the Italian bitter orange liqueur famously known for the Aperol Spritz served in the northern part of Italy during “apertif hour”.  It’s in the same family as Campari, but a little less bitter and more refined.  For this drink, I suggest a 4:1 ratio of whiskey to Aperol.,Requirements:Bourbon, rye or other blended whiskey and Aperol.  Maraschino cherry for garnish.,Combine whiskey and Aperol in an ice-filled glass and stir for 30 seconds.  Strain into a chilled cocktail glass and garnish with a maraschino cherry.,Comments:There’s nothing worse than ruining a good whiskey with a cheap sweet vermouth.  Mixing with a little Aperol instead of bad vermouth or unavailable vermouth solves that problem and doesn’t require the added bitters.  Lets face it, sometimes we just want the drink and not spend time preparing.  This is about as simple as a cocktail mix can get and still yield a smooth, tasty whiskey drink.

It originated in the south, though no one knows for sure if it started in Mississippi. It’s deceptively smooth and easy to drink, but has the components to pack a punch (pun intended, because I don’t think this is like your mother’s party punch).  For that reason, you may stretch it out some with club soda … or not.  The portions below are for a single serving.  Multiply the same proportions out for a group where a punch bowl can be used.,Requirements:brandy (or cognac), Jamaica dark rum, bourbon, club soda (optional), lemon, orange juice, simple syrup,Combine ingredients in an ice-filled shaker and shake thoroughly.  Pour into an old-fashioned glass and garnish with an orange wheel or wedge.  For a group, multiply portions by the number of imbibers and mix in a punch bowl.  Ornament the top of the punch bowl with pieces of orange.,Comment:If a punch bowl is used, ice may be added. But the ice might water the drink down, in which case club soda should not be used.  My preference would be to leave the ice out of the punch bowl, and put ice in a container for the individual glasses.  Also, I struggled with the correct amount of sweetner required to offset the lemon juice.

It’s one of the simplest to make, but might have been the first step into the world of mixed drinks.  It props up your favorite whiskey-rocks drink with bitters, some sugar and an orange peel.  I prefer a sweeter whiskey like bourbon; but many prefer the drier rye.  Whatever your favorite whiskey, it’s fair game.

This one is simply called aPUMPKIN-BOURBON OLD-FASHIONED(orPumpkin Old-Fashioned). It’s bourbon-based with the sweetness of pumpkin puree, maple syrup and Grand Marnier. The recipes I encountered were entirely too sweet for me and some so thick with pumpkin puree that I felt like I had just eaten pumpkin pie. I prefer this recipe with a lighter taste of pumpkin, not excessively sweet, and bourbon is easily identified in the drink, but still seasonable and fun.,Requirements:Bourbon, Grand Marnier, bitters, pumpkin puree, maple syrup, orange peel,Combine ingredients into a shaker filled with ice. Shake vigorously to evenly distribute the puree and strain into an old-fashioned glass filled with ice. Garnish with an orange peel (some recommend rosemary sprigs or cinnamon sticks).,Comment:I max out the pumpkin puree at 1 level tablespoon; but you can gauge for yourself whether you prefer more or less. Also, if Grand Marnier isn’t handy, you can try improvising with 1/4 ounce Cointreau and 1/4 ounce cognac or brandy. Enjoy while the pumpkins are out.

If the Scofflaw had a cousin, it might be the Manhattan, because it also uses rye whiskey (or bourbon) and vermouth, but substitues Grenadine for the Manhattan’s maraschino cherries.

77,2020-12,"I’ve always tested new mixes with shot-equivalent portions .  Truthfully, I sometimes enjoy these “shots” more than drinking out of the correct glassware, maybe because I know it’s freshly shaken and I can go back to another fresh portion whenever.

They displayed a beautifulNEW YORK SOURin a shot glass layered with sweet red wine at the top and whiskey sour at the bottom.  I had no such luck with the layering effect using the optional sweet vermouth (no sweet red wine was available) and forgot to use the back of a spoon when pouring.  But the small-portion shot of the cocktail was just right using the recipe below:,Requirements:bourbon or rye, lemon juice, simple syrup, Angostura bitters, dry fruity red wine or sweet red vermouth,Mix all ingredients except for the wine/vermouth in an ice-filled shaker.  Shake vigorously to chill and pour into 2 or 3 shot glasses half-way.  Gently pour the red wine or sweet red vermouth over the back of a small spoon held just above each drink’s surface so that it floats on the top.,Comments:As theTimesarticle pointed out, this is a gentler way to do a toast with a friend or friends without the knockout punch of the standard tequila or bourbon shot.

79,2021-06,"Applejackevolved from American apple brandy back in the 1600’s [SeeHistory]. It’s as American as apple pie and is underrated as a cocktail mixer. Many mixologists and bartenders in the know agree that Applejack is a better mixer than so-called prestigious European apple brandies. Two such Applejack recipes are known simply asAPPLEJACK NO. 1andAPPLEJACK NO. 2.  Both are equally delicious.  Your choice of the two depends upon whether you prefer sweetening with Demerara Syrup (simple syrup can also be used) or with sweet vermouth.,Applejack No. 1,Shake ingredients in an ice-filled shaker.  Strain into a rocks glass filled with ice.,Applejack No. 2,Substitute sweet vermouth (1/2 oz.) for the syrup sweetener used in Applejack No. 1.  Shake and strain into an ice-filled rocks glass.,History:The American colonists increased hard cider’s alcohol content by leaving barrels outside overnight to freeze, a method known as “jacking,”  which allowed drinkers to separate the higher-proof alcohol.   “Applejack” became the product of Scotsman and distiller  William Laird (1698)  in New Jersey and was such a favorite of George Washington that Laird shared the recipe with Washington, who shared Applejack with the state of Virginia.  Today, Laird’s Applejack is a pure spirit beverage made from a blend of apple brandy and neutral grain spirits.  Federal guidelines for Applejack require that it be a blend of at least 20% apple distillate with neutral grain spirit and aged at least two years in oak.,Comment:As America’s oldest spirit (before bourbon), an Applejack cocktail is a great way to celebrate Thanksgiving and Independence Day.,Tags:applebrandyapplejackbrandycocktailcocktail&sonscocktailsdemerarasyrupgeorgewashingtonlairdlaird&companyregansorangebitterssimplesyrupwhiskey,February 6, 2020,March 1, 2022,July 31, 2021,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

82,2021-04,"ABRANDY SOURis a an ages-old alternative to the standardWhiskey Sourfor those not fond of whiskey, or for those who seek the fruitier zest of brandy.  Since brandy is produced by distilling wine or fermenting fruit juices versus whiskey’s distillation of grain mash (corn, rye, barley, wheat, etc.), brandy brings a sometimes sweeter blend to the Sour than whiskey.  Proportions have changed many times over the years. The balance that I prefer is in the following recipe:,Requirements:Brandy or cognac, fresh lemon juice, Angostura bitters, simple syrup,Combine liquid ingredients in an ice-filled shaker.  Shake to blend and chill, then strain into an ice-filled glass.  Garnish with a lemon wheel and maraschino cherry.,Alternative RecipeThere have been variations of the Brandy Sour over the last 170 years, sometimes with egg whites, sometimes with powdered sugar, but usually with fresh lemon juice.

93,2020-01,"DIRTY MARTINI:A dry vodka martini, having about 125 calories per serving, is one of the cleanest low-cal cocktails available.  Vodka’s activated charcoal filtration system removes impurities and coloring, making it smooth and mellow.  Olive lovers enjoy splashing olive juice or brine into the martini mix, making the vodka “dirty”.  If you’re on calorie watch, it adds only about 25 calories more.  The ratio of olive juice to vodka depends on the individual’s taste for olive strength in the drink.  My recommendation is detailed below:,Requirements:Vodka, extra dry vermouth, olive juice or brine from jar, cocktail olives.,Line the inside of a shaker with extra dry vermouth by shaking vermouth with ice and pouring out vermouth.  Add vodka, olive juice and more ice if necessary.  Shake vigorously until the shaker’s outside forms condensation.  Pour into a martini glass and serve “up.” Garnish with 2-3 olives on a skewer.,Comments:Like the classic martini, use your best vodka.  Unlike sugary fruit juices which can sometimes hide a “cheap” vodka, olive juice accents your existing vodka.  Think of the olive juice as showcasing your vodka. Although the Dirty Martini is wonderful for any time or occasion, I particularly like it before a meal to clean the palate.,Dirty Gin Martini:Replace vodka with gin.,January 8, 2020,June 9, 2020,January 4, 2020,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

The recipe was presented last summer by founder and CEO of Square One Botanical Vodka, Allison Evanow, as a vodka alternative to the gin gimlet for those who don’t care for gin.  She stated that “the peppery notes of this Gimlet offset all the spirit’s floral and fruit notes.” But it works beautifully with gin.

I enjoyed it using Hendrick’s.  You can experiment with the Scotch by trying a blend like Dewar’s or a smoky single malt Scotch like Laphroaig.  The Smoky Martini is appealing before a hearty meal, good for more formal business get-togethers, or simply any occasion where tasty & strong is more important than sweet & fruity.,Origin:Norman Mailer’s 1991 novelHarlot’s Ghostpresented a character based on a real-life 1950’s CIA agent who mixed a Martini by rinsing the ice in a shaker with Scotch before adding gin.

106,2021-07,"Just as theLong Island Iced Teauses a lot of different spirits that mask each other’s flavor, so does theTOKYO TEA.Take away the cola and add Japan’s signature Midori melon liqueur with club soda and sweet & sour mix …  you’ve got the Tokyo Tea.  It’s theMidorimelon liqueur that gives the drink its green color.  A sweet & sour mix can easily be made with simple syrup and fresh lime instead of the bottled mixers which often contain additives and fake sugar.  If you’ve got the spirits available and a maraschino cherry or two, the recipe goes like this:,Requirements:Gin, rum, tequila, vodka, melon liqueur, Cointreau, sweet & sour mix*, club soda, lemon wheel, maraschino cherry,Combine the non-bubbly ingredients to an ice-filled shaker or directly to a highball glass with ice.  Shake, or stir, the ingredients to combine and chill.  Top with a splash of club soda or seltzer.  Garnish with a lemon wheel and maraschino cherry.,Comments:For a smooth tea-named drink with no actual tea, this drink falls outside tea-time.  Keep in mind that each serving contains two ounces of hard liquor and another one ounce of liqueur — closer to a margarita in strength.  The melon flavor of the Midori liqueur adds a nice summery infusion to this mix and balances nicely with the orange liqueur (Cointreau couldn’t fit in picture above).,*The variable lies with the 1 oz. sweet & sour mix.  I used the juice from one lime and added simple syrup to the balance remaining within the one ounce allotment.  My preference is for less sweet; so I’d reduce the total sweet & sour mix a bit, or use more lime in the combo.,Enjoy the Tokyo Olympics.

Pour liquid ingredients into an ice-filled shaker and shake vigorously. Strain into the glass. Squeeze a lemon twist over the drink and then drop into the mix.,Comment:I find the lemon twist to be an equal player in this cocktail and short of adding lemon juice, should always be included. If using a very botanical gin with heavy juniper and herbal qualities, I prefer less gin (.75-1 oz.). Attached below is the link to the James Bond scene when he proceeds to order and instruct how to make a Vesper.

TheALMOND CIGARis an award-winning cocktail invented by one of the owners of a famous bar in Prague called Bugsy’s.  I’d agree with the “award-winning” label on this rum drink.  It’s a very good tart/sweet thirst-quenching drink and is worth purchasing Disaronno Amaretto if you don’t have it.  Add to the Amaretto a good golden or dark rum along with sweetened lime juice and I think you’ll agree.,Requirements:Golden or dark rum, Amaretto (Disaronno preferred), lime cordial, cinnamon stick and lime twist for garnish,Combine all ingredients in an ice-filled shaker and shake vigorously for 15-30 seconds.  Strain into a chilled martini glass and garnish with a lime twist or cinnamon stick.,Comments:First, you can experiment with different types of rum, either golden or dark.  It’s recommended that a 3 y/o golden rum like Havana Club be used. (The 12-year El Dorado, pictured above, didn’t work as well as a 5-year Angostura golden rum.)  Second, lime cordial is recommended because it has a certain sweet-sour tartness that regular lime juice doesn’t have.  I found my self-made lime cordial fresher, made by fresh-squeezing one lime, adding water (1/2 oz.) and simple syrup (1/4 oz.).  If you have citric acid (I didn’t), add 1/4 oz.  You can experiment based on your sweet/sour preferences.  Enjoy this very good rum drink.,History of the name:I don’t know how this rum, lime & Amaretto drink was namedAlmond Cigar.

TheCLASSIC DAIQUIRIhowever is simple and balanced when high quality ingredients are used.  The recipe calls for a mix of light rum and a darker demerara sugar syrup, although simple syrup is okay to use if the demerara sygar syrup hasn’t been prepared (instructions detailed below).  Attention to detail pay off in achieving the perfect balance of sweet & acidity.,Requirements:Light rum, fresh lime juice, demerara sugar syrup (or simple syrup), lime twist,Combine all liquid ingredients into an ice-filled shaker and shake vigorously.  Strain into a chilled coupe and garnish with a lime twist or lime wheel.,Demerara Syrup:  This will add more depth of flavor than the standard simple syrup.  Take either a 2-1 ratio or 1-1 ratio of sugar to water, depending on your desire for sweetness, and combine in a pan on a stove top.  Heat at a light simmer until all the sugar dissolves, then cool before using.  The syrup has notes of molasses and toffee which will also pair well with dark spirits like bourbon and brandy; so bottle it and hang on to it.,Special Notes:Just as Cubans are known for their excellent hand-rolled cigars, it’s recommended here that the limes are rolled before juicing and then squeezed by hand, versus a juicer.

But it was not exactly family friendly — really more of a sailor’s paradise where navy personnel came to let off steam after long periods at sea.

122,2020-08,"MALIBU RUM(original) is a coconut-flavored liqueur with some rum in it.  Although it’s less than the 80 proof — which disqualifies it from being classified as a rum — it’s made from sugarcane molasses, like all rum, and flavored with real coconuts.  It’s only 21 proof.  But this “sunshine in a bottle with a smooth rich flavor” drink slides down the throat easily and gets you buzzed before you realize it. It is distilled in Barbados … probably.  It’s one of the distributor Pernod Ricard’s best- sellers and is now packaged in cans as well as its famous eye-catching bottle.,So I’m not alone in liking Malibu Rum Original in the summer.

124,2020-02,"Here’s a drink for your next party.MISSISSIPPI PUNCHbecame a crowd-pleaser during the U.S. Civil War.  It originated in the south, though no one knows for sure if it started in Mississippi. It’s deceptively smooth and easy to drink, but has the components to pack a punch (pun intended, because I don’t think this is like your mother’s party punch).  For that reason, you may stretch it out some with club soda … or not.  The portions below are for a single serving.  Multiply the same proportions out for a group where a punch bowl can be used.,Requirements:brandy (or cognac), Jamaica dark rum, bourbon, club soda (optional), lemon, orange juice, simple syrup,Combine ingredients in an ice-filled shaker and shake thoroughly.  Pour into an old-fashioned glass and garnish with an orange wheel or wedge.  For a group, multiply portions by the number of imbibers and mix in a punch bowl.  Ornament the top of the punch bowl with pieces of orange.,Comment:If a punch bowl is used, ice may be added. But the ice might water the drink down, in which case club soda should not be used.  My preference would be to leave the ice out of the punch bowl, and put ice in a container for the individual glasses.  Also, I struggled with the correct amount of sweetner required to offset the lemon juice.

125,2021-09,"The MOJITO is an iconic Cuban cocktail that emerged from a Havana bar around 1910. It’s a bartender’s least favorite concoction to make in a bar, not because it requires many types of liquor, but because it’s time-consuming to prepare properly. So avoid ordering these from the bartender and make them at home, where you can also be sure that your mint is fresh. The video tutorial link above shows the steps.,Requirements:8-10 mint leaves, mint sprig, simple syrup, white rum, lime juice, seltzer/club soda,In a Collins glass, gently muddle the mint leaves with simple syrup. Add white rum, lime juice and seltzer (or club soda). Fill glass halfway with crushed ice and stir. Top the glass with more crushed ice and gently incorporate with a quick stir. Garnish with a mint sprig. Place straw between the mint sprig leaves.,Particulars:Place the mint leaves in the palm of your hand and slap them hard with the other to open the mint oils before placing the sprig leaves garnish in the glass. Some like to top the glass, after filled with crushed ice, with a bit more seltzer or even sometimes more rum (3/4 oz.). Many disagree with the addition of any seltzer or club soda at all. Cuban Mojitos use sugar instead of simple syrup. Some methods suggest shaking (pre-seltzer), not stirring. Others like to muddle quarter cuts of lime with mint at the base of the Collins glass and leave the lime inside the drink, much like a caipirinha.  You can pick and choose your favorite preparation method.,History:  The Mojito evolved from an earlier 16th-century drink similar to a Caipirinha which was used to settle the stomach of the Englishman Sir Francis Drake, who was a “privateer” (pirate) and later switched out the cachaca for rum.,Favorite Drink Of:Ernest Hemingway,Tags:bacardiclearrumclubsodacubancocktailscubandrinksernesthemingwayhavanahavanacocktailshavanadrinkslimelimejuicemintmintleavesmojitorumsilverrumsimplesyrupsletzer,January 16, 2020,April 12, 2022,December 26, 2019,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

It’s a tropical-style drink that with black rum, or preferably a black-strap rum, has more of a smokey overtone than the white rum drinks. It’s a variation of a 1978 recipe for theJungle Birdout of  Hilton Hotel’sAviary Barin Kuala Lampur.  This one is a creation of Lauren Schell of NYC’sLittle Branchbar and Theo Lieberman of NYC’sMilk & Honey.  A pinch of salt is added to the top of the drink as an interesting offset to the sweet and bitter.  Hence the “salty.” This is the third in my week-long celebration of Campari drinks.,Requirements:Cruzan Black Strap Rum (or black rum), Campari, pineapple juice, lime juice, lime wedge, simple syrup, salt.,Combine all liquid ingredients in an ice-filled shaker.  Shake and strain over a glass with ice.  Add a large pinch of salt to the top and garnish with a lime wedge or dehydrated pineapple.,Comments:Cruzan Black Strap Rumis the recommended rum for this drink. I usedGosling’sBlack Seal Rumin my mix.  It was still delicious and gave it a more complex edge over the more common white rum tropical drinks — with the help of Campari.   Though with pineapple juice in the mix, you still feel just a few steps away from the pool, beach or anyplace outdoors.   But as there are just as many Salty Bird recipes which call for white rum, you can try the mix with white rum if that’s what you have handy.

131,2021-07,"Just as theLong Island Iced Teauses a lot of different spirits that mask each other’s flavor, so does theTOKYO TEA.Take away the cola and add Japan’s signature Midori melon liqueur with club soda and sweet & sour mix …  you’ve got the Tokyo Tea.  It’s theMidorimelon liqueur that gives the drink its green color.  A sweet & sour mix can easily be made with simple syrup and fresh lime instead of the bottled mixers which often contain additives and fake sugar.  If you’ve got the spirits available and a maraschino cherry or two, the recipe goes like this:,Requirements:Gin, rum, tequila, vodka, melon liqueur, Cointreau, sweet & sour mix*, club soda, lemon wheel, maraschino cherry,Combine the non-bubbly ingredients to an ice-filled shaker or directly to a highball glass with ice.  Shake, or stir, the ingredients to combine and chill.  Top with a splash of club soda or seltzer.  Garnish with a lemon wheel and maraschino cherry.,Comments:For a smooth tea-named drink with no actual tea, this drink falls outside tea-time.  Keep in mind that each serving contains two ounces of hard liquor and another one ounce of liqueur — closer to a margarita in strength.  The melon flavor of the Midori liqueur adds a nice summery infusion to this mix and balances nicely with the orange liqueur (Cointreau couldn’t fit in picture above).,*The variable lies with the 1 oz. sweet & sour mix.

Nate Dumas, at the Shanty (NY Distilling Co., Brooklyn, NY), originally mixed it to be served straight up, but thought it too thick and switched to rocks in a Collins glass. It’s an interesting twist on a Mister Katz’s Rock & Rye-inspired cocktail.  I tried it with the rye and Scotch and still very much enjoyed it.

And vice-versa, the scotch softens the amaretto liqueur.  Though some recipes for this cocktail call for equal parts of each ingredient, this one tones down the sweetness and merely accents the whisky with liqueur.,Requirements:whisky (blended scotch preferred), amaretto,Combine both ingredients into an ice-filled cocktail glass and stir.

140,2020-02,"I didn’t understand the point of theSCOTCH & SODAuntil I watched a bartender serve it.  First, he filled a tall, narrow-mouthed highball glass with ice and walked away. A minute later he reported back to swirl the ice for several seconds before pouring it out. He refilled it halfway with fresh ice before pouring single-malt Glenlivet scotch into 1/3 of the glass. He placed it before the businessman at the bar and filled the rest of the glass with club soda. The man nodded okay to the lemon peel garnish.  It was elegant without being self-indulgent, classy without being fussy.  Simple and whisky-delicious.  As I found out later, with the right soda the scotch flavor is still there to enjoy, but easier on the constitution.  It would also seem to be the right kind of cocktail for this particular customer who was having a business-type conversation with the gentleman sitting next to him.,Requirements:Scotch, soda, lemon or orange peel (optional),Chill or freeze a highball glass.

The blended scotch whiskies are usually recommended:  Dewar’s, Johnnie Walker Black, or Cutty Sark.  The little 10 oz. bottles of club soda are great for a good fizz.  The most recommended club soda isFever-Tree.  The amount of club soda used is by individual taste; the common serving is 4-5 oz. Garnishing is optional, but serving the Scotch & Soda in a tall thin (highball) glass is a must to preserve the bubbles.

Actually, the crushed ice doesn’t dilute the whisky’s flavor…unless you drink it 3 hours later. The whisky’s underlying taste will seem more vibrant than if you were to gulp it down straight.

Also, using a mix of sugar and salt on the glass rim is important because just using one or the other over-powers the drink. This can be served on the rocks as well.

More than one serving, and it’s definitely a good candidate for producing a morning hangover.  But sometimes we all just need one stiff one, and then move on.  And when we move on, it can’t be in the driver’s seat of a moving vehicle. The mix is legitimate and remarkable in that as strong as it is, it’s as smooth as silk.  It emulates an iced tea.  Its invention is actually credited to a Hampton Bays bartender named Robert Butt. His original mix called for 1 oz. of each non-cola ingredient. The recommendation in most circles is to serve 1/2-to-3/4 oz. of each non-cola ingredient.

147,2019-12,"The drink of choice for writer Jack Kerouac and singer Jimmy Buffet,the MARGARITAis one of the most festive, popular drinks.  It first appeared in Mexico and then southern California in the 1930’s and ’40’s and since then has generated cash flow for many a Mexican restaurant.  As tequila brand options have increased in both quality and quantity, so has the popularity of the margarita.,My personal Margarita preference is the most simple, without additional mixes or sweeteners, and is chilled by shaking before pouring over ice. It requires only three ingredients: tequila, Cointreau & lime juice.,Rim the glass with salt after wetting rim with a lime wedge.  Discard the wedge. Fill the glass with ice.  Combine ingredients into an ice-filled cocktail shaker.  Shake well and strain into the prepared glass.  The glass may be garnished with a lime slice or not.,Reminder:  1.5 oz. equals 1 jigger;  3/4 oz. equals 1 pony.,Comments:  Obviously, rimming the glass with salt is optional.,Simpler is better, but allowing this basic recipe to “hydrate” on rocks for five minutes helps make it smoother from the start.  Also, smaller ice cubes work better than larger cubes in a Margarita.,Prove me wrong, but I’m convinced you can judge the quality of a Mexican restaurant by its Margarita.  If the bartender adds a (1) “sweet & sour” mix to a (2) “house” tequila and (3) Triple Sec liqueur — most of the time I’d be better off going somewhere else to eat and drink.,December 20, 2019,December 18, 2021,February 20, 2021,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

It offsets additional lime juice with Agave syrup, but still maintains similar proportions of orange liqueur to tequila as the traditional margarita. Bartaco is a chain of about 19 Mexican restaurants with a very active bar. It usually uses specific liquor in its margarita: Libelula tequila and Combier orange liqueur. This recipe is provided courtesy ofTastyBevandbartaco.,Requirements: libelula silver tequila, Combier orange liqueur, fresh lime juice, blue agave syrup.,Squeeze juice from 1 – 1.5 limes. If salting your glass, rim glass with juice from lime, turn upside down and rub salt onto rim. Fill salted glass with ice. Combine ingredients in an ice-filled shaker, shake until chilled, and pour into ice-filled glass.,Comments:This margarita is very smooth and limey in comparison to the more traditional margarita recipes. If you prefer slightly less lime, you don’t need as much agave syrup.

149,2020-06,"ThePINEAPPLE MARGARITAis one of the flavored margaritas that seems most natural.  Many recipes are heavy on the pineapple juice, and as always, my preference is for a more level balance with the other ingredients.  Who needs all the additional sugar if you can accomplish the same flavoring with less juice?  Since Cointreau or Triple Sec liqueur is involved, you really don’t need much more sweetening from pineapple, even though more lime juice is used than in the traditional margarita.,Because margaritas are often served for two or more people, I’ll provide the proportions in “parts” rather than ounces.  For one serving, I’d make 1 part equal to 1 jigger (or 1.5 oz) and pineapple juice of 1.5 parts equal to 1 1/2 jiggers (or 2 oz.).  If you make 1 part equal 1 cup, you’ll yield four servings.,REQUIREMENTS:Silver or gold tequila (silver Herradura preferred), Cointreau, pineapple juice (canned Dole is fine), fresh-squeezed lime juice, mint leaves, pineapple chunks,Add a few mint leaves to the bottom of a margarita glass and muddle slightly.  Rim the glass with salt beforehand if that’s your preference.  Add ice to glass. Combine all liquid ingredients to an ice-filled shaker. Shake until chilled and pour into the margarita glass.  Garnish with 1-2 frozen pineapple chunks or one fresh pineapple wedge.,Comment:I prefer pouring margaritas over ice.  But if you like them straight up, shake the mix 20-30 seconds before pouring, to make it icy cold. The mint is a nice added touch to this recipe, but unnecessary if you don’t have any available.,Tags:cointreaudolegoldtequilaherraduralimejuicemargaritamexicandrinkspineapplepineapplejuicepineapplemargaritasilvertequilatequila,March 6, 2020,June 19, 2021,February 24, 2020,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

152,2020-02,"(This recipe courtesy of  bartender Tommy at Gigante Bar & Restaurant, Eastchester, NY.),TheSOHOcocktail is a mix of ingredients I didn’t expect to like, but did.  The bartender at Gigante Bar in Eastechester, NY shared this recipe with me.  It’s a botanical tasting martini-style drink served “up”.  Although it certainly would have a summer appeal, I had absolutely no problem putting it away on an 18-degree Valentine’s Day evening.  The way the vodka, tequila and ginger liquor offset each other and take on a cucumber-mint essence makes it well worthy of mention.,Requirements:Stoli cucumber vodka, silver tequila, Domaine de Canton ginger liqueur, lemon juice, mint.,Mix all liquid ingredients into an ice-filled shaker and shake vigorously.  Strain into a martini glass and sprinkle about 10 fresh mint leaves in the drink.  Garnish with a cucumber slice (optional).  Serve “up”.,Comments:I used the cucumber garnish too much by sliding the slice around the glass rim before drinking, which guaranteed cucumber would be the dominant flavor.  On second try, I’d take away the cucumber garnish before drinking or request slightly more ginger liqueur than cucumber vodka.  Otherwise, this is a well-rounded drink that packs a punch without tasting like it.  And FYI, I’ve noticed ginger liqueur in a number of cocktail recipes; so I might get myself a bottle now that I have use for it.,August 29, 2020,October 28, 2021,October 8, 2021,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

This  classic drink requires only three ingredients — silver tequila, grenadine and orange juice. It doesn’t even require stirring because the grenadine is meant to sink to the bottom when poured to invoke a sunrise, hence the name. Though I used a standard rocks glass in mine (pictured above), a highball glass filled with ice will more clearly create the grenadine “sunrise.”,Mix tequila and orange juice in a chilled rocks glass or highball glass filled with ice.  Top with grenadine, letting it sink to the bottom of the glass.

It’s theMidorimelon liqueur that gives the drink its green color.  A sweet & sour mix can easily be made with simple syrup and fresh lime instead of the bottled mixers which often contain additives and fake sugar.  If you’ve got the spirits available and a maraschino cherry or two, the recipe goes like this:,Requirements:Gin, rum, tequila, vodka, melon liqueur, Cointreau, sweet & sour mix*, club soda, lemon wheel, maraschino cherry,Combine the non-bubbly ingredients to an ice-filled shaker or directly to a highball glass with ice.  Shake, or stir, the ingredients to combine and chill.  Top with a splash of club soda or seltzer.  Garnish with a lemon wheel and maraschino cherry.,Comments:For a smooth tea-named drink with no actual tea, this drink falls outside tea-time.  Keep in mind that each serving contains two ounces of hard liquor and another one ounce of liqueur — closer to a margarita in strength.  The melon flavor of the Midori liqueur adds a nice summery infusion to this mix and balances nicely with the orange liqueur (Cointreau couldn’t fit in picture above).,*The variable lies with the 1 oz. sweet & sour mix.  I used the juice from one lime and added simple syrup to the balance remaining within the one ounce allotment.

Both versions are probably prepared best with the old trusty blender. If preparing a frozen slushy version, many like to cut their melon into cubes and leave in the freezer before mixing with ice in a blender. If serving the drink over ice, either shake the watermelon blend with ice in a cocktail shaker before straining into a glass, or simply blend everything in the blender and pour directly over ice.,Requirements:chopped watermelon, tequila, Cointreau or Triple Sec, fresh lime juice, lime wedge, ice, salt,Serving for 1 large glass (double the portions for 2):,If salting the glass, first rim the margarita glass with the inside of a juiced lime and dip the glass into salt. Crush watermelon into a measuring container. To a blender add the watermelon, lime juice, tequila, orange liqueur and ice. Blend until all ingredients are incorporated with a slushy texture for the frozen, slushy version, and pour directly into a margarita glass. Or for the rocks version, blend until mixed, transplant into an ice-filled cocktail shaker & shake until chilled and strain into an ice-filled margarita glass.,Comments:The drink will always be on the thicker side because of the melon; but it can be thinned if desired by pouring the blended watermelon through a cocktail strainer.,*NYC’sBaylander, which sits on the Hudson River adjacent to W130th St., uses a Patron Reposado, watermelon puree, Cointreau, lime juice and serves it cleverly with cork and straw in a Patron bottle (pictured above).

160,2021-11,"HARRY POTTER BUTTERBEERis a good cold-weather, Christmassy drink.  It may or may not have been based onButtered Beer, which was a real drink. The earliest reference to Buttered Beer was fromTheGood Huswifes Handmaide for the Kitchinpublished in London in 1588 A.D.— made from beer, sugar, eggs, nutmeg, cloves and butter back in Tudor times (see link below). For a shorter prepare time, a similar and delicious cocktail version of Harry Potter’s Butterbeer can be mixed with just 4-5 ingredients:,Requirements:butterscotch schnapps, vanilla vodka, cream soda, whipped cream, butterscotch syrup,Add vanilla vodka, butterscotch schnapps and cream soda to a frosted mug.  Top with a generous amount of whipped cream and butterscotch syrup drizzled on top of the whipped cream.,Comments:This old-time drink which was fictionalized into the Harry Potter novels by J.K. Rowling celebrates twenty years since the first Harry Potter movie release. There are many non-alcoholic versions ofButterbeerwhich resemble butterscotch & ice cream fountain shakes and can be found online. The Harry Potter theme park, when last I saw, serves only the non-alcoholic interpretation of Butterbeer. So unless you’d like to go for the original Buttered Beer, there would seem to be much room for your own interpretation and experimentation for this desert-type drink.  I like the one above, but might consider adding a shot of whiskey to it next time.,Demonstration of original Buttered Beer:,Tags:butterbeerbutteredbeerbutterscotchschnappsbutterscotchsyrupchamberofsecretscreamsodaharrypotterjkrowlingjohnwilliamssorcerersstonevanillavodkawhippedcream,April 30, 2022,January 13, 2022,January 23, 2021,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

If one prefers to make this less a desert and more a cocktail, use 1.5 oz. vanilla vodka instead of .75 oz.

If you don’t know what you like, the establishment’s mix might disappoint you. So it’s in our best interest to know what we like in our Cosmo. Here’s my recommendation, which has been influenced more or less (they use a dash of Rose instead of Citron Vodka) from the 1796 Room Restaurant at the Omni Bedford Springs Hotel in Bedford, PA. I’d go with this recipe:,Fill a cocktail shaker with ice. Add liquid ingredients. Shake for 10-15 seconds until the shaker is frosty on the outside. Strain into a martini glass. Drop a slice of lime into drink.,Comments:The cranberry juice used should be the standard original, not the unsweetened, and should be slightly less in proportion than the amount of vodka to prevent being overly sweet. The color should be pink, not red. Also, citron vodka adds a layer that makes it special, but it’s better to add less than more — too much will make the Cosmo too sweet.

163,2020-01,"DIRTY MARTINI:A dry vodka martini, having about 125 calories per serving, is one of the cleanest low-cal cocktails available.  Vodka’s activated charcoal filtration system removes impurities and coloring, making it smooth and mellow.  Olive lovers enjoy splashing olive juice or brine into the martini mix, making the vodka “dirty”.  If you’re on calorie watch, it adds only about 25 calories more.  The ratio of olive juice to vodka depends on the individual’s taste for olive strength in the drink.  My recommendation is detailed below:,Requirements:Vodka, extra dry vermouth, olive juice or brine from jar, cocktail olives.,Line the inside of a shaker with extra dry vermouth by shaking vermouth with ice and pouring out vermouth.  Add vodka, olive juice and more ice if necessary.  Shake vigorously until the shaker’s outside forms condensation.  Pour into a martini glass and serve “up.” Garnish with 2-3 olives on a skewer.,Comments:Like the classic martini, use your best vodka.  Unlike sugary fruit juices which can sometimes hide a “cheap” vodka, olive juice accents your existing vodka.  Think of the olive juice as showcasing your vodka. Although the Dirty Martini is wonderful for any time or occasion, I particularly like it before a meal to clean the palate.,Dirty Gin Martini:Replace vodka with gin.,January 8, 2020,June 9, 2020,January 4, 2020,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

Since the Shirley Temple tries to pretend it’s a vodka-type cocktail in the first place, it’s not a big step adding a couple ounces of vodka to the Shirley Temple mix and just changing the name (although “dirty” in this case does not imply olive brine).

165,2021-02,"TheGENOA VODKAcocktail:       When Genoa-born Christopher Columbus explored the New World in 1492, he was soon joined by Russia’s czar Ivan III (The Great).  Ivan had heard of Columbus’ exploits and after following his nautical trail, set up a secret meeting with Columbus in a Bahamas orchard.  There, Ivan III discussed a trade deal whereby in return for Russia’s rye-wheat grain liquor called vodka, Columbus would give Russia an equal value of spices.  Columbus admitted that he was not in possession of such spices yet, but that he would trade the Italian aperitif bitters, Campari, for the Vodka.  The two tried a sample of each other’s product, which they happened to have on hand.  Ivan III thought the Italian bitters too bitter, and Columbus thought the Russian liquor too plain.  They decided to mix the two using a formula of 2 parts vodka to 1 part Campari.  Still, Ivan III thought the mix too bitter.  Columbus, looking around the orchard, took a ripe-looking orange and cut it into quarters using his double-edged sword.  He squeezed about 3 ounces of orange juice into the mix.  Ivan tasted it and smiled, as did Columbus, and a vodka cocktail was born. However, the deal fell through when Ivan III asked for ice and Columbus had none.,Requirements:Vodka, Campari, fresh orange juice, orange slice for garnish,Combine all liquid ingredients in an ice-filled shaker.  Shake vigorously and strain into an ice-filled old-fashioned glass.  Garnish with an orange slice.,Comments:Tall tales aside, this is a delicious Campari drink for the Campari enthusiast.

Prepare it a few days in advance with a lemon peel, refrigerate, and your work is done when the occasion arrives.,Requirements:1.5 cups vodka, 1/3 cup sliced ginger (4-5 inches), lemon peel, 1 pint jar with lid,Peel 4-5 inches of a fresh ginger root using a spoon.  Wash and slice the ginger into quarter-inch pieces and put into a 1-pint jar container.  Add 1.5 cups of voda and a lemon peel to the jar, cover, and shake.  Store the sealed container in a cool, dark place for 5 days, shaking occasionally.  After five days, pour the vodka through a strainer and discard the ginger solids.  Return the strained, infused vodka to a clean bottle or suitable container with a lid.  Store the infused vodka in the refrigerator or freezer for up to 1 month.,Notes:Don’t use “upper shelf” vodka for this.  Your ginger and lemon can just as easily create a great infused vodka with Tito’s or Absolute as it can Russian Standard Platinum or Grey Goose.,Comments:I became a fan of infused vodka in Saint Petersburg, Russia when it was served at the Hotel Astoria. Their great assortment of vodka infusions served icy cold were unbeatable.  Later, I ordered infused vodka at the original Russian Tea Room in NYC and was again impressed and felt it was a close second to the Hotel Astoria.  You can buy ginger vodka in a store, but it will never be the same quality as when you infuse it with fresh ingredients yourself.,I find that ginger vodka helps digest a heavy meal, or even stimulate your appetite for a heavy meal.

Also,Difford’s Guide(of British fame) recommends stirring rather than shaking to avoid thinning the drink.

Fans of theLemonDropor theCosmoshould enjoy this limey orange-liqueur & vodka mix.  In fact, the Cosmo was created afterward as a cranberry-added Kamikaze spin-off.  What pushes the Kamikaze into respectable territory is the use of premium vodka, quality orange liqueur and fresh-squeezed lime juice.  Made well, it’s got all the refreshing qualities of a classic daiquiri, though shooters shouldn’t be ruled out.  If you want a trip down memory lane, yell, “Banzai!” just before downing it.,Requirements:Vodka, orange liqueur (prefer Cointreau or high-end Triple Sec), freshly squeezed lime juice, lime wheel for garnish,Shake ingredients in an ice-filled shaker for 10-15 seconds.  Strain into a chilled cocktail glass (or shot glasses).  Garnish the cocktail glass with a lime wheel.,Comments:The recipe above is on the “dryer” side and is recommended when using premium vodka — a vodka you would choose for a martini or straight.  For a richer and slightly sweeter cocktail, I’d recommend this mix:  1.5 oz. vodka, 1 oz. orange liqueur, .75 oz. lime juice.  Some prefer 1 oz. equal parts, all three ingredients.  You should adjust the ratio to suit your taste. The orange liqueur can be a higher-end triple sec or a good curacao.  Turn the Kamikaze into a pretty blue color by pouring blue curacao instead of triple sec/Cointreau.  The better the individual ingredients, the better the Kamikaze.,HIstory:The Kamikaze was invented on an American naval base in Japan after WWII.  The wordkamikazeis a Japanese word which means “divine wind,” referring to the typhoon which the Mongols ran into while trying to invade Japan in the 13th century.  The word was incorrectly applied by the Japanese military for its pilots and their sometimes impossible or suicidal missions. The drink probably took on its name due to its Japanese origins, it’s bold yet simple flavors and its kick.,For the sake of accuracy, the correct Japanese word to use before drinking isKanpai.,Tags:cocktailscointreaujapanesecocktailsjapanesedrinkskamikazeketelonelimejuicerussianplatinumvodkarussianstandardvodkashooterssummercocktailssummerdrinkstitosvodkatriplesecvodkavodkashots,June 27, 2021,February 15, 2020,April 21, 2021,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

And when we move on, it can’t be in the driver’s seat of a moving vehicle. The mix is legitimate and remarkable in that as strong as it is, it’s as smooth as silk.  It emulates an iced tea.  Its invention is actually credited to a Hampton Bays bartender named Robert Butt. His original mix called for 1 oz. of each non-cola ingredient. The recommendation in most circles is to serve 1/2-to-3/4 oz. of each non-cola ingredient.  (I use a pony measurer, 3/4 ounce for each.),Requirements:vodka, gin, white rum, silver tequila, orange liqueur, lemon juice, cola, lemon wedge,Rim a collins glass with a lemon wedge. Either add all non-cola ingredients directly to the ice-filled Collins glass and stir, or first shake in an ice-filled shaker before straining into the ice-filled Collins glass.

173,2020-09,"TheVODKA MARTINIgradually overtook the popular gin martini when vodka achieved worldwide popularity beginning in the 1940’s. It didn’t hurt that the “vodka martini, shaken-not-stirred” was ordered in every James Bond movie in the 60’s.  It’s simple to make, but delicate to the drinker’s taste. Most are customized to a person’s vodka choice and amount of dry vermouth used. “Extra dry” is usually a request for just a hint of vermouth via a drop or two.  Sometimes a vermouth rinse of the shaker before the mix is all that’s required by those that like it extra extra dry.,Required:Vodka, dry vermouth, green pimento martini olives,Fill a shaker with ice. Pour 1/2-3/4 oz. dry vermouth into shaker. Shake it well to thoroughly distribute the shaker with vermouth. Pour excess vermouth out through a strainer for an extra dry martini; leave vermouth in for a standard formula martini. Add 3 oz. (2 jiggers) of vodka. Shake vigorously for 5-10 seconds. Strain into a martini glass (pre-chilled is ideal) and serve with green pimento martini olives on a cocktail spear, lemon peel or cocktail onion. Usually it’s served straight up, although some might like ice.,Tip:There is no disguising a bad vodka in a martini.

174,2021-09,"The Japanese melon liqueur,Midori, is the predominant flavor of theMELON BALL DROP.  The sweetness of the Midori, and to a lesser extent the elderflower liqueur, is balanced nicely by vodka and fresh lemon juice.  It’s a popular choice for New Year’s Eve; but you may not want to wait for a once-a-year occasion to have one.,Requirements:Melon liqueur (Midori preferred), elderflower liqueur (St-Germain preferred), vodka, lemon juice, melon ball/cube for garnish (honeydew preferred),Combine all liquid ingredients into an ice-filled shaker.  Shake vigorously and strain into a martini glass.  Garnish with a cocktail skewer of 3-4 melon balls (or cubes) and rest vertically along side of the glass to complete the “ball drop” look.  Optional:  Rim the chilled glass with sugar.,Comments:TheMelon Ball Dropleans toward being sweet, especially if you follow more common recipes.  I’ve  reduced some of the sweetness by using equal parts Midori and vodka, versus the more common 2:1 ratio of Midori to vodka.  For a slightly sweeter drink that adds more complexity, you can use citron vodka instead of plain vodka.  Rimming the glass with sugar is nice if presenting the drink as an after-dinner drink; otherwise, the additional sugar really isn’t necessary.  If you’re a fan of the full-flavored martini (i.e.,Cosmopolitan, Apple Martini), this is a must-have.

It’s a fizzy, limey-ginger vodka drink that offers a spicy kick when made with real ginger beer. Ginger beer can be substituted with ginger ale for those who don’t like the spiciness of real ginger. Diet versions are available with either. It can be served in a cocktail rocks glass or the preferred frozen copper mug (above).,Requirements:Vodka, lime, ginger beer (or ale), copper mug or cocktail glass,Fill a cocktail glass or frozen copper mug with ice.

The mug or glass should be pre-chilled or frozen and the ginger beer refrigerated in advance.

176,2020-08,"ThePINK PEPPERCORN BOTANICAL GIMLETis a fancy name for a limey gin gimlet with some pink peppercorn accents.  It’s surprisingly refreshing, tasty, and great for a summertime drink.  The hardest part of the preparation is simply getting the pink peppercorns from the store.  Otherwise, it just takes ten minutes to mix and pour.  The recipe was presented last summer by founder and CEO of Square One Botanical Vodka, Allison Evanow, as a vodka alternative to the gin gimlet for those who don’t care for gin.  She stated that “the peppery notes of this Gimlet offset all the spirit’s floral and fruit notes.” But it works beautifully with gin.  The owner of Aviation gin, Ryan Reynolds (actor), might be pleased to hear that his American gin gets a big thumbs up in this mix, over the intended botanical vodka.,Requirements:Gin (or Square One Botanical Vodka), pink peppercorns, fresh lime juice, lime wheel, agave nectar,In a cocktail shaker, lightly muddle the pink peppercorns until crushed.  Add remaining ingredients with ice and shake until icy cold.  Double-strain (pour through the shaker and through another mesh-type filter) into an ice-filled old-fashioned glass.  Garnish with 5-6 peppercorns and a lime wheel.,Comments:As a newcomer to the world of gin drinks, I was very pleasantly surprised that I found this mix so refreshingly agreeable.  My problem was I enjoyed it so much that I drank it too fast and quickly made another.  Live and learn.  I’ll one day try the recipe with Square One Botanical Vodka as intended; but until then, I’m happy to have found this gimlet recipe to enjoy during the remaining summer days ahead.

It wakens the taste buds and has enough interesting layers to appeal to every fan of the vodka cocktail. Since working with the mix a few times, I thought it might be helpful to share a better tasting and simpler preparation of this drink than ones often published.,Requirements: vodka, elderflower liqueur, simple syrup, grapefruit, lime, rosemary sprig (optional) & lemon wedge garnish,Strain fresh grapefruit juice into an ice-filled shaker with other liquid ingredients and shake vigorously. Strain into a chilled martini glass. Garnish with a lemon wedge or rosemary sprig (optional).,Comment:A rosemary sprig garnish adds a botanical nature to the drink and a lemon wedge can be added to provide a nice sour-mix balance.  I prefer squeezing a few drops of the lemon wedge into my mix, but rarely do I have a rosemary sprig to throw in.  Adding a dash of grapefruit bitters is an option if available and gives the drink a solid backing (think of the bass in Led Zeppelin).,This is a summertime favorite at our home.

178,2020-07,"ThePOMEGRANATE MARTINIis similar to a Cosmo, but more complex and probably stronger, while still going down easy — at least by this recipe. It’s had a wide appeal in my little circle of imbibers, even more-so than the Cosmo. Basically, the sweetness of pomegranate, orange liquor and citron vodka are stretched out by adding regular vodka (very unorthodox) and fresh lime juice for tartness. Yes, pomegranate juice has its share of sugar, but it’s also rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals and bioactive plant compounds that I convince myself has to count for something. The pomegranate martini might be a step or two more in the making than a Cosmo, but in my opinion, has more interesting layers.,Requirements:Vodka, Citron Vodka, Cointreau, pomegranate juice and fresh lime juice.,For a single serving, 1 part equals 3/4 oz. or one pony. For serving two, 1 part equals a 1.5 oz. jigger in place of the pony.,Pour all liquid ingredients into a cocktail shaker filled with ice. Shake vigorously for 10-15 seconds. Strain into a cold martini glass. Garnish with a lime slice or 2-3 pimento cocktail olives (see video demo above).,Comment:I had never garnished pomegranate martinis with anything. If using any garnish, the natural one would seem to be a lime wedge. But a friend insisted on green cocktail olives with her pomegranate martini and my wife and I found this to be an excellent combo. The saltiness of the olive is a good offset to the pomegranate, sort of like the friendliness of salt to chocolate.,Celebrities who prefer the Pomegranate Martini:Madonna, Charlize Theron,Tags:absolutevodkacocktailscointreaucosmojuiceketelonelimepomegranatepomegranatemartinirussianstandardtitosvodka,July 8, 2020,March 3, 2020,January 30, 2020,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

179,2020-02,"(This recipe courtesy of  bartender Tommy at Gigante Bar & Restaurant, Eastchester, NY.),TheSOHOcocktail is a mix of ingredients I didn’t expect to like, but did.  The bartender at Gigante Bar in Eastechester, NY shared this recipe with me.  It’s a botanical tasting martini-style drink served “up”.  Although it certainly would have a summer appeal, I had absolutely no problem putting it away on an 18-degree Valentine’s Day evening.  The way the vodka, tequila and ginger liquor offset each other and take on a cucumber-mint essence makes it well worthy of mention.,Requirements:Stoli cucumber vodka, silver tequila, Domaine de Canton ginger liqueur, lemon juice, mint.,Mix all liquid ingredients into an ice-filled shaker and shake vigorously.  Strain into a martini glass and sprinkle about 10 fresh mint leaves in the drink.  Garnish with a cucumber slice (optional).  Serve “up”.,Comments:I used the cucumber garnish too much by sliding the slice around the glass rim before drinking, which guaranteed cucumber would be the dominant flavor.  On second try, I’d take away the cucumber garnish before drinking or request slightly more ginger liqueur than cucumber vodka.  Otherwise, this is a well-rounded drink that packs a punch without tasting like it.  And FYI, I’ve noticed ginger liqueur in a number of cocktail recipes; so I might get myself a bottle now that I have use for it.,August 29, 2020,October 28, 2021,October 8, 2021,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

It’s theMidorimelon liqueur that gives the drink its green color.  A sweet & sour mix can easily be made with simple syrup and fresh lime instead of the bottled mixers which often contain additives and fake sugar.  If you’ve got the spirits available and a maraschino cherry or two, the recipe goes like this:,Requirements:Gin, rum, tequila, vodka, melon liqueur, Cointreau, sweet & sour mix*, club soda, lemon wheel, maraschino cherry,Combine the non-bubbly ingredients to an ice-filled shaker or directly to a highball glass with ice.  Shake, or stir, the ingredients to combine and chill.  Top with a splash of club soda or seltzer.  Garnish with a lemon wheel and maraschino cherry.,Comments:For a smooth tea-named drink with no actual tea, this drink falls outside tea-time.  Keep in mind that each serving contains two ounces of hard liquor and another one ounce of liqueur — closer to a margarita in strength.  The melon flavor of the Midori liqueur adds a nice summery infusion to this mix and balances nicely with the orange liqueur (Cointreau couldn’t fit in picture above).,*The variable lies with the 1 oz. sweet & sour mix.  I used the juice from one lime and added simple syrup to the balance remaining within the one ounce allotment.  My preference is for less sweet; so I’d reduce the total sweet & sour mix a bit, or use more lime in the combo.,Enjoy the Tokyo Olympics.

186,2022-02,"Developed in McKeesport just southeast of Pittsburgh, theFUSSFUNGLEsweetens a rye Old-Fashioned with a special recipe of burnt brown sugar and molasses.  The sweetening mixture makes for a delicious whiskey treat and should be prepared in advance.  If you’re in the mood for something a little sweeter after dinner, a perfect companion for a cigar or even a 5PM pick-me-up, theFussfungleis a tasty two-ingredient cocktail to serve and quick to prepare when the syrup is in hand.,Requirements:Rye whiskey (Rittenhouse Bottled-In-Bond preferred), burnt brown sugar & molasses syrup (brown sugar, water, molasses), orange bitters (optional), orange peel garnish (optional),Add first the syrup to an ice-filled mixing glass, then the whiskey. A dash or two of orange bitters is optional. Stir until very chilled. Strain over a large ice cube in a rocks glass.  An orange peel may be added as garnish.,Burnt Brown Sugar-Molasses Syrup– Heat ½ cup of brown sugar in a small saucepan until sugar begins to darken on the edges. Stir and continue to cook over medium heat until melted and darkened further. Remove from heat and add ½ cup of water. Stir until sugar has dissolved fully and add ¼ cup molasses. Stir until molasses has dissolved. Remove from heat and refrigerate for up to one month.*,Comments:I used organic blackstrap molasses with brown sugar and found it delicious. If preparing as a standard Old-Fashioned, I’d use 1/2 – 3/4 oz. brown sugar-molasses syrup. The ratio of 2:1 whiskey to syrup works best for a sweeter drink.,History:TheFussfunglebecame Pittsburgh’s most popular nationwide cocktail export pre-prohibition.

188,2020-03,"IRISH COFFEEis a  combination of our two favorite ingredients, hot coffee and whiskey.  I  always tie it into Christmas-preparation relief or Saint Patrick’s Day.   It began in the 1950’s when an Irish airport bartender mixed the two  together to warm up travelers.  It’s fun and easy to make because it can  vary based on the ingredients you have at home.The traditional Irish  coffee is just strong coffee, Irish whiskey, and double (heavy) whipped  cream served in an Irish coffee glass.Some use a teaspoon of brown  sugar or maple syrup along with whipped cream.  The other option, my  favorite which requires no sweetener, is with Bailey’s Irish Cream  (detailed below):,Requirements:Irish whiskey, Bailey’s Irish Cream, hot coffee, whipped cream (optional),If available, pre-warm an Irish coffee glass or glass mug, or just use a  coffee mug.  Mix liquid ingredients (and sweetener if used) in glass.   If double whipped cream is used, pour onto a warmed spoon placed at the  top of the coffee line until 1/4 inch cream forms above the coffee line.   Otherwise, top the coffee with regular whipped cream.,Comments:You’ll have to taste-test your Irish Coffee for sweetness.   As said, my preference is to use the Baileys Irish Cream, which takes  care of the need for whipped cream and additional sweetener.  But just  make sure that your coffee is extra strong if you’re using Baileys Irish  Cream, because it and the whiskey dilute the coffee. If Baileys Irish  cream isn’t available, start with either a teaspoon of brown sugar or a  teaspoon of maple syrup. Then top with the whipped cream.  With Irish  Coffee, you can wing it based on your preference and on what you have  available.,Tags:doublecreamirishcoffeeirishwhiskeyjamesonwhiskey,September 16, 2020,January 30, 2020,September 27, 2021,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

189,2021-03,"IRISH SIDECAR:Instead of mixing your Sidecar cocktail with cognac or brandy, celebrate Saint Patrick’s Day by substituting with Irish Whiskey.  Irish whiskey is noted for being light and smooth because it’s triple distilled and is made with unmalted barley.  For this reason, Irish whiskey is a great mixer whiskey and works particularly well in the Sidecar formula. It’s hard not to like a drink when you’re faced with a sugar-rimmed coupe glass.,Requirements:Irish Whiskey (Jameson preferred), Cointreau, lemon juice, simple syrup, sugar for glass rim,Rim a chilled coupe glass with water or lemon juice and dip the rim onto powdered sugar to create a sugar crust. Combine ingredients in an ice-filled shaker.  Shake vigorously and strain into the coupe glass.,Comments:Whether Irish or not, everyone deserves a mid-March Saint Patrick’s Day break, especially after a year of COVID-19 quarantine and distancing.  Start the day with steel-cut Irish oatmeal and toasted Irish soda bread. Have a mid-day Guinness beer with corn beef & cabbage while wearing a funny green hat. Go to mass or watch a half-hour of Irish step-dancing* on YouTube … or nap. Have Irish stew with a pint ofBlack & Tan(Guinness beer & Bass Ale) for dinner and end it with anIrish Sidecar.Remember, all whiskey began with Irish whiskey. And for that, we owe the old monasteries of Ireland.

But Jameson is triple distilled, leaving out some of the impurities that help define certain bourbons, and is aged at least three years. Jameson’s flavor has been characterized as, “the sweet fragrance of malted barley with butter tones and subtle oak notes.. hints of spicy nut mixing in and out… finishes with honey and spicy, smoky snaps of barley that work through the long fade.”*  Add lemon juice, maple syrup (or simple syrup) and you have a smooth, delicious Whiskey Sour.,REQUIREMENTS:  Jameson Whiskey, fresh lemon juice, maple syrup or simple syrup, lemon wedge, maraschino cherry,Combine all liquid ingredients into an ice-filled shaker and shake to chill.  Strain into a lowball or Old Fashioned glass halfway filled with ice.  Garnish with a lemon wedge and cocktail cherry.,COMMENTS:  You might increase the syrup to 3/4 oz. if you prefer sweeter.

191,2021-07,"“It’s less sweet than bourbon but not as powerful and peaty as some Scotches, striking an appealing balance,” say some reviewers of Japanese whiskies.,In 2003’s filmLost In Translation, Bill Murray portrayed a middle-aged actor hired to be in a Japanese whisky commercial for Suntory, which seemed like a small-market joke back then. Now, Japan is the third-largest whisky-producing nation behind the U.K. and the United States.  U.S. sales revenue of Japanese whisky jumped from $1.5 million in 2011 to $24.7 million in 2017.  Japan’s whisky industry doesn’t have the ancient traditions that Saki has, but its production finesse and attention to quality have made it successful.  Because of its international success, the suppliers have had shortages, causing a bottle which once was $50 to rise to $150, and resulting in some scarcity in the U.S. liquor stores. Nonetheless, some who sip a Japanese whisky neat for the first time claim it’s “like standing on a mountain in Japan,” and it’s “more refined, subtle, complex.”* [See some informative & fun links below.],History,About 1923, outsiders came to Japan often carrying bottles of Scotch with them.  An entrepreneur who was born into a family of sake brewers –Masataka Taketsuru — traveled to Scotland to learn the whisky trade and henceforth learned the craft of whisky-making at the Scottish distilleries and from chemistry courses at the University of Glasgow.  He became the Godfather of Japanese whisky in the development of their whisky industry in the Scottish Style.,Best Japanese Whiskies(prices vary),Links to “Best Japanese Whiskies”:,https://www.liquor.com/best-japanese-whiskies-5078590,https://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/a27466729/best-japanese-whiskey-bottles/,*Link to TODAY SHOW’s Japanese Whisky Report, 7/27/21:,https://www.today.com/video/celebrating-japanese-whiskey-and-sake-117449285671,Tags:akashihibikijapancocktailsjapanesewhiskymarsshinshuiwainikkasinglemaltsuntorysuntorytokitokiwhiskyblendsyamazaki,May 6, 2020,May 21, 2022,January 8, 2020,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

192,2021-03,"You’ll not find theMANHATTAN MINUTEanywhere but here.  It’s self-created, self-named and is offered to the home bartender as aManhattansubstitute when preparation-time is short or good sweet vermouth is not available.  Aperol replaces the sweet vermouth and bitters which comprise a traditionalManhattan, allowing the preparer to mix aManhattan-like cocktail in less time with just two easily-measured ingredients.,Aperol is the Italian bitter orange liqueur famously known for the Aperol Spritz served in the northern part of Italy during “apertif hour”.  It’s in the same family as Campari, but a little less bitter and more refined.  For this drink, I suggest a 4:1 ratio of whiskey to Aperol.,Requirements:Bourbon, rye or other blended whiskey and Aperol.  Maraschino cherry for garnish.,Combine whiskey and Aperol in an ice-filled glass and stir for 30 seconds.  Strain into a chilled cocktail glass and garnish with a maraschino cherry.,Comments:There’s nothing worse than ruining a good whiskey with a cheap sweet vermouth.  Mixing with a little Aperol instead of bad vermouth or unavailable vermouth solves that problem and doesn’t require the added bitters.  Lets face it, sometimes we just want the drink and not spend time preparing.  This is about as simple as a cocktail mix can get and still yield a smooth, tasty whiskey drink.

193,2021-07,"Highballs are a very popular way to experience cocktails in Japan, especially whisky, and using Matcha green tea powder in drinks is great because it adds the enjoyable earthy flavor.  AMATCHA HIGHBALLmight be just the drink to enjoy during the summer Tokyo Olympics.  With either club soda or seltzer to top the mix, the recipe is relatively standard:,Requirements:Japanese whisky (preferably Hibiki), lemon juice, honey, matcha green tea powder, club soda or seltzer,In an ice-filled shaker, combine whisky, lemon juice, honey syrup and matcha.  Shake vigorously and pour into a chilled, ice-filled highball glass.  Pour club soda or seltzer into the shaker, swirl around to rinse and then add to the glass.  Stir and garnish with a lemon wheel (optional).,Almond Milk option:Instead of topping the drink with club soda, replace with 3 oz. of almond milk for an exceptionally smooth matcha/whisky cocktail.,Comments:Though Hibiki whisky is recommended in theMatcha Highball, you might experiment with other whiskey blends if you don’t have Hibiki.  I experimented using Jack Daniel’s and it worked fine.  Since Japanese whisky is modeled after Scotch, maybe Dewar’s would work better. Still, others suggest Japanese whisky reminds them of Irish whisky. But the Hibiki whisky “uses a special bamboo charcoal filtering step and a blend of at least 10 malt and grain whiskies from three distilleries, aged in five different cask types, with some elements aged up to approximately 20 years” which have resulted in winning several whisky awards.,Tags:greenteagreenteapowderhibikihibikiwhiskyhighballjapanesecocktailsjapanesedrinkslemonjuicematchahighballmatchateaolympicspopularjapanesedrinkstokyococktailstokyodrinkswhisky,August 21, 2021,June 5, 2020,April 5, 2020,Good info.

It works, it’s easy, and it certainly goes down easy.,Requirements:Gin, blended whiskey, lemon juice, simple syrup, mint sprigs,Combine all liquid ingredients in an ice-filled shaker. Shake vigorously and strain into an old-fashioned glass filled with ice.  Garnish with two mint leaves or mint sprig.,Comments:I prefer drinking this straight up in a chilled martini glass with the caveat that it’s strong and should be sipped.  That said, the common method of serving this is on-the-rocks, old-fashioned glass, mint sprigs.  Either way (maybe we’ll callmy waythe winter version and the rocks version the summer version), trying theSeaboardfor the first time is a tasty surprise.  The  whiskey and gin merge well.  I used Jameson Irish Whiskey in mine, but the recipe works for any bourbon or  blended whiskies.

199,2020-12,"I’ve always tested new mixes with shot-equivalent portions .  Truthfully, I sometimes enjoy these “shots” more than drinking out of the correct glassware, maybe because I know it’s freshly shaken and I can go back to another fresh portion whenever.  So theNY Times‘ 12/28/20 article titled,“Ring Out 2020 With Shots You’ll Actually Enjoy”was right down my alley.  They displayed a beautifulNEW YORK SOURin a shot glass layered with sweet red wine at the top and whiskey sour at the bottom.  I had no such luck with the layering effect using the optional sweet vermouth (no sweet red wine was available) and forgot to use the back of a spoon when pouring.  But the small-portion shot of the cocktail was just right using the recipe below:,Requirements:bourbon or rye, lemon juice, simple syrup, Angostura bitters, dry fruity red wine or sweet red vermouth,Mix all ingredients except for the wine/vermouth in an ice-filled shaker.  Shake vigorously to chill and pour into 2 or 3 shot glasses half-way.  Gently pour the red wine or sweet red vermouth over the back of a small spoon held just above each drink’s surface so that it floats on the top.,Comments:As theTimesarticle pointed out, this is a gentler way to do a toast with a friend or friends without the knockout punch of the standard tequila or bourbon shot.  I would add that shots of any 2-ingredient cocktails, e.g. the Black Russian (a good after-dinner shot), dirty martini or Jean Harlow are fun to prepare as shots.

201,2022-02,"Out of 1898 Boston comesWARD EIGHT, an elaboration of the Whiskey Sour using rye whiskey, lemon juice, orange juice and grenadine.  It’s  wonderfully flavorful and intriguing, enough so that it deserves a revival.  It’s also a good small-group drink to have on hand for get-togethers and Super Bowl parties. Although the Ward Eight adds orange juice and grenadine to the Sour, the complexity and balance makes this a winner over the more popular Whiskey Sour.,REQUIREMENTS:rye whiskey, lemon juice, orange juice, grenadine, cocktail cherry and/or orange wedge for garnish,Add liquid ingredients to an ice-filled shaker.  Shake vigorously and strain into a coup glass.  Garnish with a cocktail cherry and/or an orange wedge.,COMMENTS:Rye whiskies recommended for the Ward Eight are:  Bulleit, Woodford Reserve, Knob Creek, Crown Royal and Sazerac.  The grenadine measurement can go up to two teaspoons if you like it sweeter. If you want to switch out the rye for bourbon, that’s perfectly fine too, and stay with the lesser grenadine.,PARTY COCKTAIL:  This is a good small-group cocktail (4-8) which can be measured by multiplying the amounts above by the number of drinks.  One tip:  Measure out the mix into an ice-less container that can hold all the mix (8-12 oz.). When ready, pour just enough of the mix into an ice-filled shaker to serve. For Super Bowl Sunday, have the garnishes and glassware ready and you’re all set.,HISTORY:Named after a Boston election district in 1898, Ward #8 helped win the election for political czarMartin M. Lomasneyto the state’s legislature. The cocktail was created to honor his election. The state election of that year has been all but forgotten, but the cocktail remains.,,Tags:cocktailgrenadinehomecocktailslemonjuicepartycocktailsryeryecocktailsryewhiskeydrinkssuperbowlsuperbowlcocktailssuperbowldrinksward8wardeightwhiskey,September 2, 2020,January 23, 2021,November 5, 2020,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

202,2021-08,"Cachaca is to Brazil’sCAIPIRINHA,as Tequila is to Mexico’sMargarita;though the Caipirinha is less Americanized as the Margarita.The Caipirinha’sbasic recipe is very simple but requires that you muddle sugar onto crushed quarters of lime before adding cachaca. When prepared properly, it’s one of the most refreshing of cocktails.  For a good Caipirinha, it’s worth having a bottle of cachaca on hand.,Requirements:Cachaca, fresh lime, sugar, muddler,Cut half lime into 4 quarters. Cut away white skin from lime to avoid bitterness. Put lime quarters into glass along with 2 teaspoons of sugar and crush with muddler, 14-15 times. Add cachaca. Add either small ice cubes or crushed ice. Stir well and garnish glass with lime wheel or wedge.,The facts about Cachaca:Cachaca is fermented and distilled from sugar cane, though not from the molasses side-product that rum requires. Cachaca is distinctly Brazilian because it is aged in Brazilian hardwoods; rum is aged in bourbon barrels constructed from American oak and can be made anywhere.,Comment:There are a couple of tips — First, using good Cachaca is key. I’ve been presented with two excellent bottles of cachaca which I list below. Second, the white skin on a lime can create a bitterness to the drink, so it’s recommended that it be cut away before adding to the glass. Getting the proper balance between sugary sweetness, strong cachaca and lime’s tartness is tricky and may require some improvisation. As someone who tries to limit sugar intake, I’ve tried all forms of alternative sweeteners and nothing works as well as plain old sugar.,Tim-tim!

Try theCANEFLOWERcocktail.  It was created in 2009 by Oregon’s famous barman, mixologist and writer, Jeffrey Morgenthaler.  It’s an alternative cachaca drink that’s semi-sweet with flavors of elderflower, bitter orange and in my recipe, lime.,Requirements:Cachaca (Novo Fogo Silver/ Boca Loca Cachaca preferred), St-Germain Elderflower liqueur, Aperol, orange twist, lime wedge (optional),Combine all ingredients in an ice-filled mixing glass. Stir until chilled and strain into a small chilled cocktail coupe.  Garnish with an orange twist or lime wedge.,Notes:Though the flavors noted in descriptions of Aperol are “bitter orange, gentian, rhubard and cinchona among other ingredients” and it’s color is also orange, I don’t think the orange twist is appropriate for this drink.  The orange twist is visually correct, but lime isflavor-correct, and adds balance.  Lime can freshen its cachaca partner again as far as I’m concerned and works well with elderflower liqueur.

205,2021-08,"We salute and toast the dedication and accomplishments of all athletes who made the Olympic journey to Tokyo, 2021. A nice Japanese drink to toast them is theSHOCHU MELON CITRUScocktail.  The Japanese liquor, shochu (detailed below), is extremely popular in Japan, but not as well known internationally as its sake. Shochu’s clean and mild flavor is similar to vodka in allowing many elaborations and opportunities for cocktails. Here’s one that can be fine-tuned to suit your taste:,Requirements:Shochu, melon liqueur (Midora preferred), club soda or seltzer (optional) fresh lemon juice, cherry and/or orange slice,Add all ingredients except club soda to an ice-filled shaker.  Shake well and strain into an ice-filled glass.  A dash (1.5 oz.) of club soda or seltzer may be added.  Stir gently.  Garnish with a maraschino cherry and/or orange slice.,Shochu:In Japan, shochu is actually more popular than sake and is different in several ways.  Shochu is distilled; sake is fermented.  Shochu is made from either barley, sweet potato or rice; sake is made only from rice.  Shochu is stronger at 25-30% alcohol; sake is 15-18% alcohol.  Good quality shochu – Honkaku Shochu, or classic shochu – issingledistilled, so it retains the characters of the base ingredient. A sweet potato shochu is very different from a rice shochu.  Because of the variations in flavor, not all shochu works in every shochu cocktail.,Comments:I like adding the dash of club soda or seltzer to this drink.  With two garnishes added, it becomes multi-dimensional in flavor. I used a roasted barley-derived Honkaku Shochu which gave it a slight nutty/sesame flavor. There is other popular shochu derived from rice & sweet potato, which I can’t yet speak for.  Bottles of shochu at my nearby NYC wine & liquor store ranged from $21-55.,Tags:clubsodacocktailcocktailshonkakuhonkakushochujapanesecocktailskintarolemonjuicemelonliqueurmidoriliqueurmidorimelonliqueurolympiccocktailsolympicdrinksolympicsolympictoastssakeseltzershochushochumelon citrusshochumeloncocktail,December 31, 2019,October 11, 2020,January 10, 2020,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

TheALMOND CIGARis an award-winning cocktail invented by one of the owners of a famous bar in Prague called Bugsy’s.  I’d agree with the “award-winning” label on this rum drink.  It’s a very good tart/sweet thirst-quenching drink and is worth purchasing Disaronno Amaretto if you don’t have it.  Add to the Amaretto a good golden or dark rum along with sweetened lime juice and I think you’ll agree.,Requirements:Golden or dark rum, Amaretto (Disaronno preferred), lime cordial, cinnamon stick and lime twist for garnish,Combine all ingredients in an ice-filled shaker and shake vigorously for 15-30 seconds.  Strain into a chilled martini glass and garnish with a lime twist or cinnamon stick.,Comments:First, you can experiment with different types of rum, either golden or dark.  It’s recommended that a 3 y/o golden rum like Havana Club be used. (The 12-year El Dorado, pictured above, didn’t work as well as a 5-year Angostura golden rum.)  Second, lime cordial is recommended because it has a certain sweet-sour tartness that regular lime juice doesn’t have.  I found my self-made lime cordial fresher, made by fresh-squeezing one lime, adding water (1/2 oz.) and simple syrup (1/4 oz.).  If you have citric acid (I didn’t), add 1/4 oz.

208,2022-01,"TheITALIAN MARGARITAsubstitutes Amaretto and orange juice for the regular margarita’s orange liqueur.  Amaretto gives it a sweet nutty edge and eliminates the need for simple syrup or agave.  Lime juice, with an optional lemon juice squeeze to create a sour mix, is the citrus addition that has proven to work so well with tequila. The tequila of preference is a silver or blanc tequila; but aged reposado tequila is favored by some.,Requirements:Silver tequila, Amaretto liqueur, fresh-squeezed orange juice, lime juice, lemon juice (optional), lime wedge garnish, salt & sugar,Rim the serving glass with the juice of a lemon and dip onto a combination salt and sugar.

Strain into the serving glass and garnish with a lime wedge.,Comments:I recommend using fresh-squeezed orange juice and then straining the pulp before adding to the shaker. You can experiment with the choice of silver versus aged tequila — it’s a matter of personal taste; but use good tequila.  Also, using a mix of sugar and salt on the glass rim is important because just using one or the other over-powers the drink. This can be served on the rocks as well.

213,2020-02,"THE BOULEVARDIER(“boo- lah-var-dee-ay”) is first cousin to the Negroni cocktail, but substitutes bourbon or rye whiskey for the gin.  It’s had a resurgence since its initial presentation almost 100 years ago.  Some say it’s an aquired taste because of its bitterness or tartness.  It might be a bit like developing a taste for certain cheeses, vinegars, or even broccolie rabe.  It wakens the palate on first sip, and gets easier with each one that follows.  Like a lot of drinks, the likability of your Boulevardier depends a lot on the caliber of the spirits used.  Some prefer rye whiskey; I prefer bourbon.  Some like it stirred with ice and then strained into a cocktail glass without ice; I prefer stirring directly in a rocks glass — it’s certainly easier.,Requirements:Bourbon (or rye whiskey), Campari, sweet vermouth, orange twist,Stir all ingredients in a rocks glass.  Squeeze an orange twist above the drink and drop in glass.,Comment:I like the bourbon (or rye) to take dominance to the other two ingredients.  So if you’re just doing 1.5 oz. (1 jigger) bourbon, then do slightly less than 1 jigger of the other two.  The orange twist is important, i.e., more than just a pretty garnish.

Garnish with an orange twist or lime wedge.,Notes:Though the flavors noted in descriptions of Aperol are “bitter orange, gentian, rhubard and cinchona among other ingredients” and it’s color is also orange, I don’t think the orange twist is appropriate for this drink.

216,2021-02,"TheGENOA VODKAcocktail:       When Genoa-born Christopher Columbus explored the New World in 1492, he was soon joined by Russia’s czar Ivan III (The Great).  Ivan had heard of Columbus’ exploits and after following his nautical trail, set up a secret meeting with Columbus in a Bahamas orchard.  There, Ivan III discussed a trade deal whereby in return for Russia’s rye-wheat grain liquor called vodka, Columbus would give Russia an equal value of spices.  Columbus admitted that he was not in possession of such spices yet, but that he would trade the Italian aperitif bitters, Campari, for the Vodka.  The two tried a sample of each other’s product, which they happened to have on hand.  Ivan III thought the Italian bitters too bitter, and Columbus thought the Russian liquor too plain.  They decided to mix the two using a formula of 2 parts vodka to 1 part Campari.  Still, Ivan III thought the mix too bitter.  Columbus, looking around the orchard, took a ripe-looking orange and cut it into quarters using his double-edged sword.  He squeezed about 3 ounces of orange juice into the mix.  Ivan tasted it and smiled, as did Columbus, and a vodka cocktail was born. However, the deal fell through when Ivan III asked for ice and Columbus had none.,Requirements:Vodka, Campari, fresh orange juice, orange slice for garnish,Combine all liquid ingredients in an ice-filled shaker.  Shake vigorously and strain into an ice-filled old-fashioned glass.  Garnish with an orange slice.,Comments:Tall tales aside, this is a delicious Campari drink for the Campari enthusiast.  The orange juice doesn’t take over the drink like aScrewdriver, but nicely balances everything with the vodka.  In fact, I didn’t even taste the orange juice.

Aperol replaces the sweet vermouth and bitters which comprise a traditionalManhattan, allowing the preparer to mix aManhattan-like cocktail in less time with just two easily-measured ingredients.,Aperol is the Italian bitter orange liqueur famously known for the Aperol Spritz served in the northern part of Italy during “apertif hour”.  It’s in the same family as Campari, but a little less bitter and more refined.  For this drink, I suggest a 4:1 ratio of whiskey to Aperol.,Requirements:Bourbon, rye or other blended whiskey and Aperol.  Maraschino cherry for garnish.,Combine whiskey and Aperol in an ice-filled glass and stir for 30 seconds.  Strain into a chilled cocktail glass and garnish with a maraschino cherry.,Comments:There’s nothing worse than ruining a good whiskey with a cheap sweet vermouth.  Mixing with a little Aperol instead of bad vermouth or unavailable vermouth solves that problem and doesn’t require the added bitters.  Lets face it, sometimes we just want the drink and not spend time preparing.  This is about as simple as a cocktail mix can get and still yield a smooth, tasty whiskey drink.

It’s a variation of a 1978 recipe for theJungle Birdout of  Hilton Hotel’sAviary Barin Kuala Lampur.  This one is a creation of Lauren Schell of NYC’sLittle Branchbar and Theo Lieberman of NYC’sMilk & Honey.

Though with pineapple juice in the mix, you still feel just a few steps away from the pool, beach or anyplace outdoors.   But as there are just as many Salty Bird recipes which call for white rum, you can try the mix with white rum if that’s what you have handy.

Shake for 10-15 seconds until the shaker is frosty on the outside.  Strain into a martini glass.  Drop a slice of lime into drink.,Comments:The cranberry juice used should be the standard original, not the unsweetened, and should be slightly less in proportion than the amount of vodka to prevent being overly sweet.  The color should be pink, not red. Also, citron vodka adds a layer that makes it special, but it’s better to add less than more —  too much will make the Cosmo too sweet.

In ocean lore, the sight of this phantom ship is a portent of doom.*,Or,it’s a classic gin cocktail.  Since I’ve been resistant to trying gin drinks over the years, I’m playing catchup.  And I like this one!  It’s easy to make.  It requires only gin and Cointreau (or triple sec) with a couple of additional flavorings.,Requirements:Dry gin, Cointreau, orange bitters, lemon peel,Wet the rim of a cocktail glass with a lemon peel and drop it into the glass. Combine liquid ingredients into an ice-filled shaker and shake or stir.  Strain into the prepared cocktail glass.,Comments:There are wide-ranging recipes to the Flying Dutchman.  This version is the “classic” and simplest to make.  Key to my enjoying this drink were the dashes of orange bitters and the lemon-flavored glass rim.  The end result is a clean and refreshing drink. Although, having a few of these clean & refreshing drinks you might start hearing messages from the crew of the Flying Dutchman ghost ship — they’ll be calling you for a round of gin.  Remember to add the Cointreau, bitters and lemon peel as a sign of respect.,* Wikipedia,October 8, 2021,November 27, 2021,August 21, 2020,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

229,2021-03,"IRISH SIDECAR:Instead of mixing your Sidecar cocktail with cognac or brandy, celebrate Saint Patrick’s Day by substituting with Irish Whiskey.  Irish whiskey is noted for being light and smooth because it’s triple distilled and is made with unmalted barley.  For this reason, Irish whiskey is a great mixer whiskey and works particularly well in the Sidecar formula. It’s hard not to like a drink when you’re faced with a sugar-rimmed coupe glass.,Requirements:Irish Whiskey (Jameson preferred), Cointreau, lemon juice, simple syrup, sugar for glass rim,Rim a chilled coupe glass with water or lemon juice and dip the rim onto powdered sugar to create a sugar crust. Combine ingredients in an ice-filled shaker.  Shake vigorously and strain into the coupe glass.,Comments:Whether Irish or not, everyone deserves a mid-March Saint Patrick’s Day break, especially after a year of COVID-19 quarantine and distancing.  Start the day with steel-cut Irish oatmeal and toasted Irish soda bread. Have a mid-day Guinness beer with corn beef & cabbage while wearing a funny green hat. Go to mass or watch a half-hour of Irish step-dancing* on YouTube … or nap. Have Irish stew with a pint ofBlack & Tan(Guinness beer & Bass Ale) for dinner and end it with anIrish Sidecar.Remember, all whiskey began with Irish whiskey.

230,2021-08,"The KAMIKAZE was designed for good-time shooters in the ’70’s & ’80’s, but became respectable as a cocktail later.  Fans of theLemonDropor theCosmoshould enjoy this limey orange-liqueur & vodka mix.  In fact, the Cosmo was created afterward as a cranberry-added Kamikaze spin-off.  What pushes the Kamikaze into respectable territory is the use of premium vodka, quality orange liqueur and fresh-squeezed lime juice.  Made well, it’s got all the refreshing qualities of a classic daiquiri, though shooters shouldn’t be ruled out.  If you want a trip down memory lane, yell, “Banzai!” just before downing it.,Requirements:Vodka, orange liqueur (prefer Cointreau or high-end Triple Sec), freshly squeezed lime juice, lime wheel for garnish,Shake ingredients in an ice-filled shaker for 10-15 seconds.  Strain into a chilled cocktail glass (or shot glasses).  Garnish the cocktail glass with a lime wheel.,Comments:The recipe above is on the “dryer” side and is recommended when using premium vodka — a vodka you would choose for a martini or straight.  For a richer and slightly sweeter cocktail, I’d recommend this mix:  1.5 oz. vodka, 1 oz. orange liqueur, .75 oz. lime juice.  Some prefer 1 oz. equal parts, all three ingredients.  You should adjust the ratio to suit your taste. The orange liqueur can be a higher-end triple sec or a good curacao.  Turn the Kamikaze into a pretty blue color by pouring blue curacao instead of triple sec/Cointreau.  The better the individual ingredients, the better the Kamikaze.,HIstory:The Kamikaze was invented on an American naval base in Japan after WWII.  The wordkamikazeis a Japanese word which means “divine wind,” referring to the typhoon which the Mongols ran into while trying to invade Japan in the 13th century.  The word was incorrectly applied by the Japanese military for its pilots and their sometimes impossible or suicidal missions. The drink probably took on its name due to its Japanese origins, it’s bold yet simple flavors and its kick.,For the sake of accuracy, the correct Japanese word to use before drinking isKanpai.,Tags:cocktailscointreaujapanesecocktailsjapanesedrinkskamikazeketelonelimejuicerussianplatinumvodkarussianstandardvodkashooterssummercocktailssummerdrinkstitosvodkatriplesecvodkavodkashots,June 27, 2021,February 15, 2020,April 21, 2021,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

233,2019-12,"The drink of choice for writer Jack Kerouac and singer Jimmy Buffet,the MARGARITAis one of the most festive, popular drinks.  It first appeared in Mexico and then southern California in the 1930’s and ’40’s and since then has generated cash flow for many a Mexican restaurant.  As tequila brand options have increased in both quality and quantity, so has the popularity of the margarita.,My personal Margarita preference is the most simple, without additional mixes or sweeteners, and is chilled by shaking before pouring over ice.

Also, smaller ice cubes work better than larger cubes in a Margarita.,Prove me wrong, but I’m convinced you can judge the quality of a Mexican restaurant by its Margarita.

234,2020-06,"ThePINEAPPLE MARGARITAis one of the flavored margaritas that seems most natural.  Many recipes are heavy on the pineapple juice, and as always, my preference is for a more level balance with the other ingredients.  Who needs all the additional sugar if you can accomplish the same flavoring with less juice?  Since Cointreau or Triple Sec liqueur is involved, you really don’t need much more sweetening from pineapple, even though more lime juice is used than in the traditional margarita.,Because margaritas are often served for two or more people, I’ll provide the proportions in “parts” rather than ounces.  For one serving, I’d make 1 part equal to 1 jigger (or 1.5 oz) and pineapple juice of 1.5 parts equal to 1 1/2 jiggers (or 2 oz.).  If you make 1 part equal 1 cup, you’ll yield four servings.,REQUIREMENTS:Silver or gold tequila (silver Herradura preferred), Cointreau, pineapple juice (canned Dole is fine), fresh-squeezed lime juice, mint leaves, pineapple chunks,Add a few mint leaves to the bottom of a margarita glass and muddle slightly.  Rim the glass with salt beforehand if that’s your preference.  Add ice to glass. Combine all liquid ingredients to an ice-filled shaker. Shake until chilled and pour into the margarita glass.  Garnish with 1-2 frozen pineapple chunks or one fresh pineapple wedge.,Comment:I prefer pouring margaritas over ice.  But if you like them straight up, shake the mix 20-30 seconds before pouring, to make it icy cold.

236,2020-07,"ThePOMEGRANATE MARTINIis similar to a Cosmo, but more complex and probably stronger, while still going down easy — at least by this recipe. It’s had a wide appeal in my little circle of imbibers, even more-so than the Cosmo. Basically, the sweetness of pomegranate, orange liquor and citron vodka are stretched out by adding regular vodka (very unorthodox) and fresh lime juice for tartness. Yes, pomegranate juice has its share of sugar, but it’s also rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals and bioactive plant compounds that I convince myself has to count for something. The pomegranate martini might be a step or two more in the making than a Cosmo, but in my opinion, has more interesting layers.,Requirements:Vodka, Citron Vodka, Cointreau, pomegranate juice and fresh lime juice.,For a single serving, 1 part equals 3/4 oz. or one pony. For serving two, 1 part equals a 1.5 oz. jigger in place of the pony.,Pour all liquid ingredients into a cocktail shaker filled with ice. Shake vigorously for 10-15 seconds. Strain into a cold martini glass. Garnish with a lime slice or 2-3 pimento cocktail olives (see video demo above).,Comment:I had never garnished pomegranate martinis with anything. If using any garnish, the natural one would seem to be a lime wedge. But a friend insisted on green cocktail olives with her pomegranate martini and my wife and I found this to be an excellent combo. The saltiness of the olive is a good offset to the pomegranate, sort of like the friendliness of salt to chocolate.,Celebrities who prefer the Pomegranate Martini:Madonna, Charlize Theron,Tags:absolutevodkacocktailscointreaucosmojuiceketelonelimepomegranatepomegranatemartinirussianstandardtitosvodka,July 8, 2020,March 3, 2020,January 30, 2020,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

Add liquid ingredients to an ice-filled shaker. Shake vigorously for 10-15 seconds until outside of shaker forms condensation. Strain into glass and garnish with a lemon peel.,Comments:The sugar coating on the glass rim is important to offset the tartness of the lemon juice. For that reason, I particularly like the Sidecar as an after-dinner drink or as a starter drink. But obviously it can be served up anytime and is especially refreshing in the summertime. FYI, theBetween the Sheetscocktail takes The Sidecar a step further by adding rum and subtracting the sugar rim.,Origin:The exact origin of the Sidecar is unclear, but it is thought to have been invented around the end of World War I in either London or Paris.

239,2021-09,"There are a couple of ways to prepare theWATERMELON MARGARITA:a frozen slushy version and a thinner on-the-rocks version. Both versions are probably prepared best with the old trusty blender. If preparing a frozen slushy version, many like to cut their melon into cubes and leave in the freezer before mixing with ice in a blender. If serving the drink over ice, either shake the watermelon blend with ice in a cocktail shaker before straining into a glass, or simply blend everything in the blender and pour directly over ice.,Requirements:chopped watermelon, tequila, Cointreau or Triple Sec, fresh lime juice, lime wedge, ice, salt,Serving for 1 large glass (double the portions for 2):,If salting the glass, first rim the margarita glass with the inside of a juiced lime and dip the glass into salt. Crush watermelon into a measuring container. To a blender add the watermelon, lime juice, tequila, orange liqueur and ice. Blend until all ingredients are incorporated with a slushy texture for the frozen, slushy version, and pour directly into a margarita glass. Or for the rocks version, blend until mixed, transplant into an ice-filled cocktail shaker & shake until chilled and strain into an ice-filled margarita glass.,Comments:The drink will always be on the thicker side because of the melon; but it can be thinned if desired by pouring the blended watermelon through a cocktail strainer.,*NYC’sBaylander, which sits on the Hudson River adjacent to W130th St., uses a Patron Reposado, watermelon puree, Cointreau, lime juice and serves it cleverly with cork and straw in a Patron bottle (pictured above).

If you don’t know what you like, the establishment’s mix might disappoint you.  So it’s in our best interest to know what we like in our Cosmo.  Here’s my recommendation, which has been influenced, more or less (they use a dash of Rose instead of Citron Vodka), from the 1796 Room Restaurant at the Omni Bedford Springs Resort in Bedford, PA.  I’d go with this recipe:,Requirements:Vodka, Cointreau, citron vodka, cranberry juice, lime, martini glass.,Fill a cocktail shaker with ice.  Add liquid ingredients. Shake for 10-15 seconds until the shaker is frosty on the outside.  Strain into a martini glass.  Drop a slice of lime into drink.,Comments:The cranberry juice used should be the standard original, not the unsweetened, and should be slightly less in proportion than the amount of vodka to prevent being overly sweet.  The color should be pink, not red. Also, citron vodka adds a layer that makes it special, but it’s better to add less than more —  too much will make the Cosmo too sweet. The right balance between sweet and tart is very delicate.,Movie/TV Character Signature Drink:Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker),Celebrities’ Whose Favorite Drink is the Cosmo:Toni Braxton (singer), SelaWard (actress), Jerry O’Connell (actor),June 4, 2021,April 21, 2021,August 24, 2021,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

When poured with non-Gosling’s rum, public menus might call it aSafe Harborto avoid any legal problem with the Goslings.

Squeeze medium-to-large wedge of lime over ice.  Pour bourbon into glass and top it with chilled ginger beer.  Stir and garnish with one or two fresh mint sprigs and a lime wedge.,ORIGIN:When an L.A. bartender created the Moscow Mule in the 1940’s, vodka extended its reach from Russia and Eastern Europe to the United States.  But many in the U.S. shared no affinity for vodka, thinking it bland and tasteless.  So the cocktail folks started experimenting shortly thereafter with regional spirits such as rum, tequila … and of course American whiskey.,COMMENTS:The only way to abuse this drink is to pour room-temperature ginger beer over the ice, thereby making the Kentucky Mule watery.  So have a good ginger beer in the refrigerator, likeFever-Tree,Barritts,Reeds,Powell & Mahoney,Gosling’s, or sugar-freeZevia.  You’ll get your own feel for the amount of ginger beer you prefer in your Kentucky Mule.  The extra lime wedge garnish is important because an additional lime squeeze might be needed. Having a frozen copper mug or frozen glass handy is a big plus.

264,2020-06,"TheRUM PUNCHcan easily be too sweet, or perfectly balanced and refreshing.  This particular recipe is one I consider excellent, balanced between fruity refreshment and gutsy rum strength.  When I was served this poolside at a Cape Cod location one summer, it caught my attention enough to beg the bartender to show me what he did.  I ordered a few of these drinks over 2-3 years from the same bartender (somebody had to do it), who patiently showed me what he did, in his quick bartender kind of way.  The key to my tableside and poolside enjoyment of this special punch was the dark rum floater on top — Myers’s dark.  That was the kicker. It goes quite well with lunch and other daytime enjoyment during the hot summer days.  And as summer 2020 has arrived, its time is here.,REQUIREMENTS:Light rum, dark rum, orange & pineapple juice, lime juice, grenadine,Combine all ingredients except for the dark rum into an ice-filled glass and stir or shake.  Strain into a cocktail or hurricane glass filled halfway with ice.  Add the dark rum floater gently to the top of the drink.  Garnish is optional with either a pineapple or lime wedge.  But don’t disturb the floater.,NOTES:This is a great drink to serve for two or more people.  For two, just change the measurement from the .75 oz. pony to a 1.5 oz. jigger.  For four people, you would of course multiply the jigger measurement by two.  Keep in mind that each serving gets an individualized floater of dark rum on the top — which is what makes it special.

I usually start on the lower end — in this case about 1/2 ounce — and taste first. It’s easy to add a couple more drops if needed. I also learned the hard way that one should NEVER pour Grenadine directly into the mix, but into a measuring utensil like a jigger or pony and then into the mix.,Tags:bourboncocktailsdrinksgrenadinemanhattanorangebittersprohibitionryescofflawvermouthwhiskey,September 2, 2020,June 4, 2021,January 13, 2022,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

266,2021-12,"TheTEQUILA SUNRISEis a sweet, refreshing addition to other late-morning brunch cocktails like theBloody MaryandMimosa.  This  classic drink requires only three ingredients — silver tequila, grenadine and orange juice. It doesn’t even require stirring because the grenadine is meant to sink to the bottom when poured to invoke a sunrise, hence the name. Though I used a standard rocks glass in mine (pictured above), a highball glass filled with ice will more clearly create the grenadine “sunrise.”,Mix tequila and orange juice in a chilled rocks glass or highball glass filled with ice.  Top with grenadine, letting it sink to the bottom of the glass.  Garnish with an orange slice and cherry.,Comments:You can cut back on the sweetness by adding only 1/4 oz. grenadineoronly 3 oz. orange juice.  It’s a tasty cocktail for late day/evening drinking as well.,History:TheTequila Sunrisedates back to the early 1970’s.  Mick Jagger tasted it in 1972 and used it to kick off the Rolling Stones tour, calling it“the cocaine and Tequila Sunrise tour.” The drink made further headwinds into popular culture when the Eagles released a song titled, “Tequila Sunrise” on their DESPERADO album.,,Tags:brunchcocktailscocktailcocktailsherradurasilverorangejuicerosesgrenadinesilvertequilasummercocktailstequilatequilablancotequilacocktailstequilasunrise,September 16, 2020,November 5, 2020,September 1, 2021,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

267,2022-02,"Out of 1898 Boston comesWARD EIGHT, an elaboration of the Whiskey Sour using rye whiskey, lemon juice, orange juice and grenadine.  It’s  wonderfully flavorful and intriguing, enough so that it deserves a revival.  It’s also a good small-group drink to have on hand for get-togethers and Super Bowl parties. Although the Ward Eight adds orange juice and grenadine to the Sour, the complexity and balance makes this a winner over the more popular Whiskey Sour.,REQUIREMENTS:rye whiskey, lemon juice, orange juice, grenadine, cocktail cherry and/or orange wedge for garnish,Add liquid ingredients to an ice-filled shaker.  Shake vigorously and strain into a coup glass.  Garnish with a cocktail cherry and/or an orange wedge.,COMMENTS:Rye whiskies recommended for the Ward Eight are:  Bulleit, Woodford Reserve, Knob Creek, Crown Royal and Sazerac.  The grenadine measurement can go up to two teaspoons if you like it sweeter. If you want to switch out the rye for bourbon, that’s perfectly fine too, and stay with the lesser grenadine.,PARTY COCKTAIL:  This is a good small-group cocktail (4-8) which can be measured by multiplying the amounts above by the number of drinks.  One tip:  Measure out the mix into an ice-less container that can hold all the mix (8-12 oz.). When ready, pour just enough of the mix into an ice-filled shaker to serve. For Super Bowl Sunday, have the garnishes and glassware ready and you’re all set.,HISTORY:Named after a Boston election district in 1898, Ward #8 helped win the election for political czarMartin M. Lomasneyto the state’s legislature. The cocktail was created to honor his election. The state election of that year has been all but forgotten, but the cocktail remains.,,Tags:cocktailgrenadinehomecocktailslemonjuicepartycocktailsryeryecocktailsryewhiskeydrinkssuperbowlsuperbowlcocktailssuperbowldrinksward8wardeightwhiskey,September 2, 2020,January 23, 2021,November 5, 2020,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

Squeeze a lemon twist over the drink and then drop into the mix.,Comment:I find the lemon twist to be an equal player in this cocktail and short of adding lemon juice, should always be included. If using a very botanical gin with heavy juniper and herbal qualities, I prefer less gin (.75-1 oz.).

271,2021-09,"The Japanese melon liqueur,Midori, is the predominant flavor of theMELON BALL DROP.  The sweetness of the Midori, and to a lesser extent the elderflower liqueur, is balanced nicely by vodka and fresh lemon juice.  It’s a popular choice for New Year’s Eve; but you may not want to wait for a once-a-year occasion to have one.,Requirements:Melon liqueur (Midori preferred), elderflower liqueur (St-Germain preferred), vodka, lemon juice, melon ball/cube for garnish (honeydew preferred),Combine all liquid ingredients into an ice-filled shaker.  Shake vigorously and strain into a martini glass.  Garnish with a cocktail skewer of 3-4 melon balls (or cubes) and rest vertically along side of the glass to complete the “ball drop” look.  Optional:  Rim the chilled glass with sugar.,Comments:TheMelon Ball Dropleans toward being sweet, especially if you follow more common recipes.  I’ve  reduced some of the sweetness by using equal parts Midori and vodka, versus the more common 2:1 ratio of Midori to vodka.  For a slightly sweeter drink that adds more complexity, you can use citron vodka instead of plain vodka.  Rimming the glass with sugar is nice if presenting the drink as an after-dinner drink; otherwise, the additional sugar really isn’t necessary.  If you’re a fan of the full-flavored martini (i.e.,Cosmopolitan, Apple Martini), this is a must-have.

272,2021-08,"We salute and toast the dedication and accomplishments of all athletes who made the Olympic journey to Tokyo, 2021. A nice Japanese drink to toast them is theSHOCHU MELON CITRUScocktail.  The Japanese liquor, shochu (detailed below), is extremely popular in Japan, but not as well known internationally as its sake. Shochu’s clean and mild flavor is similar to vodka in allowing many elaborations and opportunities for cocktails. Here’s one that can be fine-tuned to suit your taste:,Requirements:Shochu, melon liqueur (Midora preferred), club soda or seltzer (optional) fresh lemon juice, cherry and/or orange slice,Add all ingredients except club soda to an ice-filled shaker.  Shake well and strain into an ice-filled glass.  A dash (1.5 oz.) of club soda or seltzer may be added.  Stir gently.  Garnish with a maraschino cherry and/or orange slice.,Shochu:In Japan, shochu is actually more popular than sake and is different in several ways.  Shochu is distilled; sake is fermented.  Shochu is made from either barley, sweet potato or rice; sake is made only from rice.  Shochu is stronger at 25-30% alcohol; sake is 15-18% alcohol.  Good quality shochu – Honkaku Shochu, or classic shochu – issingledistilled, so it retains the characters of the base ingredient. A sweet potato shochu is very different from a rice shochu.  Because of the variations in flavor, not all shochu works in every shochu cocktail.,Comments:I like adding the dash of club soda or seltzer to this drink.  With two garnishes added, it becomes multi-dimensional in flavor. I used a roasted barley-derived Honkaku Shochu which gave it a slight nutty/sesame flavor. There is other popular shochu derived from rice & sweet potato, which I can’t yet speak for.  Bottles of shochu at my nearby NYC wine & liquor store ranged from $21-55.,Tags:clubsodacocktailcocktailshonkakuhonkakushochujapanesecocktailskintarolemonjuicemelonliqueurmidoriliqueurmidorimelonliqueurolympiccocktailsolympicdrinksolympicsolympictoastssakeseltzershochushochumelon citrusshochumeloncocktail,December 31, 2019,October 11, 2020,January 10, 2020,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

274,2021-02,"TheGENOA VODKAcocktail:       When Genoa-born Christopher Columbus explored the New World in 1492, he was soon joined by Russia’s czar Ivan III (The Great).  Ivan had heard of Columbus’ exploits and after following his nautical trail, set up a secret meeting with Columbus in a Bahamas orchard.  There, Ivan III discussed a trade deal whereby in return for Russia’s rye-wheat grain liquor called vodka, Columbus would give Russia an equal value of spices.  Columbus admitted that he was not in possession of such spices yet, but that he would trade the Italian aperitif bitters, Campari, for the Vodka.  The two tried a sample of each other’s product, which they happened to have on hand.  Ivan III thought the Italian bitters too bitter, and Columbus thought the Russian liquor too plain.  They decided to mix the two using a formula of 2 parts vodka to 1 part Campari.  Still, Ivan III thought the mix too bitter.  Columbus, looking around the orchard, took a ripe-looking orange and cut it into quarters using his double-edged sword.  He squeezed about 3 ounces of orange juice into the mix.  Ivan tasted it and smiled, as did Columbus, and a vodka cocktail was born. However, the deal fell through when Ivan III asked for ice and Columbus had none.,Requirements:Vodka, Campari, fresh orange juice, orange slice for garnish,Combine all liquid ingredients in an ice-filled shaker.

Also,Difford’s Guide(of British fame) recommends stirring rather than shaking to avoid thinning the drink.

278,2022-01,"TheITALIAN MARGARITAsubstitutes Amaretto and orange juice for the regular margarita’s orange liqueur.  Amaretto gives it a sweet nutty edge and eliminates the need for simple syrup or agave.  Lime juice, with an optional lemon juice squeeze to create a sour mix, is the citrus addition that has proven to work so well with tequila. The tequila of preference is a silver or blanc tequila; but aged reposado tequila is favored by some.,Requirements:Silver tequila, Amaretto liqueur, fresh-squeezed orange juice, lime juice, lemon juice (optional), lime wedge garnish, salt & sugar,Rim the serving glass with the juice of a lemon and dip onto a combination salt and sugar.  Add ingredients to an ice-filled shaker and shake for 20-30 seconds.  Strain into the serving glass and garnish with a lime wedge.,Comments:I recommend using fresh-squeezed orange juice and then straining the pulp before adding to the shaker. You can experiment with the choice of silver versus aged tequila — it’s a matter of personal taste; but use good tequila.  Also, using a mix of sugar and salt on the glass rim is important because just using one or the other over-powers the drink. This can be served on the rocks as well.

It originated in the south, though no one knows for sure if it started in Mississippi. It’s deceptively smooth and easy to drink, but has the components to pack a punch (pun intended, because I don’t think this is like your mother’s party punch).  For that reason, you may stretch it out some with club soda … or not.  The portions below are for a single serving.  Multiply the same proportions out for a group where a punch bowl can be used.,Requirements:brandy (or cognac), Jamaica dark rum, bourbon, club soda (optional), lemon, orange juice, simple syrup,Combine ingredients in an ice-filled shaker and shake thoroughly.  Pour into an old-fashioned glass and garnish with an orange wheel or wedge.  For a group, multiply portions by the number of imbibers and mix in a punch bowl.  Ornament the top of the punch bowl with pieces of orange.,Comment:If a punch bowl is used, ice may be added. But the ice might water the drink down, in which case club soda should not be used.  My preference would be to leave the ice out of the punch bowl, and put ice in a container for the individual glasses.  Also, I struggled with the correct amount of sweetner required to offset the lemon juice.  I think I got it right in the portions above, but keep your sweetner nearby in case you want more.,April 18, 2020,August 16, 2021,July 8, 2020,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

282,2020-06,"TheRUM PUNCHcan easily be too sweet, or perfectly balanced and refreshing.  This particular recipe is one I consider excellent, balanced between fruity refreshment and gutsy rum strength.  When I was served this poolside at a Cape Cod location one summer, it caught my attention enough to beg the bartender to show me what he did.  I ordered a few of these drinks over 2-3 years from the same bartender (somebody had to do it), who patiently showed me what he did, in his quick bartender kind of way.  The key to my tableside and poolside enjoyment of this special punch was the dark rum floater on top — Myers’s dark.  That was the kicker. It goes quite well with lunch and other daytime enjoyment during the hot summer days.  And as summer 2020 has arrived, its time is here.,REQUIREMENTS:Light rum, dark rum, orange & pineapple juice, lime juice, grenadine,Combine all ingredients except for the dark rum into an ice-filled glass and stir or shake.  Strain into a cocktail or hurricane glass filled halfway with ice.  Add the dark rum floater gently to the top of the drink.  Garnish is optional with either a pineapple or lime wedge.  But don’t disturb the floater.,NOTES:This is a great drink to serve for two or more people.  For two, just change the measurement from the .75 oz. pony to a 1.5 oz. jigger.  For four people, you would of course multiply the jigger measurement by two.  Keep in mind that each serving gets an individualized floater of dark rum on the top — which is what makes it special.

It’s an orange-flavored gin martini dating back to the 1930’s and credited to Harry Craddock, as published in theSavoy Cocktail Book.  It’s “perfect” in being equal parts gin, sweet vermouth, dry vermouth and orange juice.  The addition of Grand Marnier is considered the “straight” version; otherwise orange curacao can be added and it’s the “curled” version.  The proportions for the Straight Satan’s Whiskers are:,Add the liquid ingredients to an ice-filled shaker.  Shake and strain into a chilled coup or cocktail glass.  Garnish with an orange twist.,Comment:The mix of flavors in theSatan’s Whiskersresults in a complex blend of sweet, bitter & citrusy orange layers.  The Bronx cocktail is a similar combination but adds more gin.  Some recipes call for 2/3 ounces (20 mil.) in the gin/vermouth/O.J. combo and 1/3 oz. (10 ml.) Grand Marnier. The curled version calls for up to six dashes orange bitters.,Forgotten Cocktail:Satan’s Whiskershas an old world flavor to savor in each sip.

It’s  wonderfully flavorful and intriguing, enough so that it deserves a revival.  It’s also a good small-group drink to have on hand for get-togethers and Super Bowl parties. Although the Ward Eight adds orange juice and grenadine to the Sour, the complexity and balance makes this a winner over the more popular Whiskey Sour.,REQUIREMENTS:rye whiskey, lemon juice, orange juice, grenadine, cocktail cherry and/or orange wedge for garnish,Add liquid ingredients to an ice-filled shaker.  Shake vigorously and strain into a coup glass.  Garnish with a cocktail cherry and/or an orange wedge.,COMMENTS:Rye whiskies recommended for the Ward Eight are:  Bulleit, Woodford Reserve, Knob Creek, Crown Royal and Sazerac.  The grenadine measurement can go up to two teaspoons if you like it sweeter. If you want to switch out the rye for bourbon, that’s perfectly fine too, and stay with the lesser grenadine.,PARTY COCKTAIL:  This is a good small-group cocktail (4-8) which can be measured by multiplying the amounts above by the number of drinks.  One tip:  Measure out the mix into an ice-less container that can hold all the mix (8-12 oz.). When ready, pour just enough of the mix into an ice-filled shaker to serve. For Super Bowl Sunday, have the garnishes and glassware ready and you’re all set.,HISTORY:Named after a Boston election district in 1898, Ward #8 helped win the election for political czarMartin M.

Many recipes are heavy on the pineapple juice, and as always, my preference is for a more level balance with the other ingredients.

Since Cointreau or Triple Sec liqueur is involved, you really don’t need much more sweetening from pineapple, even though more lime juice is used than in the traditional margarita.,Because margaritas are often served for two or more people, I’ll provide the proportions in “parts” rather than ounces.

Rim the glass with salt beforehand if that’s your preference.  Add ice to glass. Combine all liquid ingredients to an ice-filled shaker. Shake until chilled and pour into the margarita glass.  Garnish with 1-2 frozen pineapple chunks or one fresh pineapple wedge.,Comment:I prefer pouring margaritas over ice.  But if you like them straight up, shake the mix 20-30 seconds before pouring, to make it icy cold. The mint is a nice added touch to this recipe, but unnecessary if you don’t have any available.,Tags:cointreaudolegoldtequilaherraduralimejuicemargaritamexicandrinkspineapplepineapplejuicepineapplemargaritasilvertequilatequila,March 6, 2020,June 19, 2021,February 24, 2020,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

293,2020-06,"TheRUM PUNCHcan easily be too sweet, or perfectly balanced and refreshing.  This particular recipe is one I consider excellent, balanced between fruity refreshment and gutsy rum strength.  When I was served this poolside at a Cape Cod location one summer, it caught my attention enough to beg the bartender to show me what he did.  I ordered a few of these drinks over 2-3 years from the same bartender (somebody had to do it), who patiently showed me what he did, in his quick bartender kind of way.  The key to my tableside and poolside enjoyment of this special punch was the dark rum floater on top — Myers’s dark.  That was the kicker. It goes quite well with lunch and other daytime enjoyment during the hot summer days.  And as summer 2020 has arrived, its time is here.,REQUIREMENTS:Light rum, dark rum, orange & pineapple juice, lime juice, grenadine,Combine all ingredients except for the dark rum into an ice-filled glass and stir or shake.  Strain into a cocktail or hurricane glass filled halfway with ice.  Add the dark rum floater gently to the top of the drink.  Garnish is optional with either a pineapple or lime wedge.  But don’t disturb the floater.,NOTES:This is a great drink to serve for two or more people.  For two, just change the measurement from the .75 oz. pony to a 1.5 oz. jigger.  For four people, you would of course multiply the jigger measurement by two.  Keep in mind that each serving gets an individualized floater of dark rum on the top — which is what makes it special.  As always, make sure it’s served icy cold.,Tags:bicardimyersdarkrummyersrummyerssrumpunchrumrumpunch,February 13, 2020,January 8, 2020,September 30, 2020,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

294,2020-09,"TheSALTY BIRDis a nice transition drink into fall, or a last hurrah for summer, depending on your point of view.  It’s a tropical-style drink that with black rum, or preferably a black-strap rum, has more of a smokey overtone than the white rum drinks. It’s a variation of a 1978 recipe for theJungle Birdout of  Hilton Hotel’sAviary Barin Kuala Lampur.  This one is a creation of Lauren Schell of NYC’sLittle Branchbar and Theo Lieberman of NYC’sMilk & Honey.  A pinch of salt is added to the top of the drink as an interesting offset to the sweet and bitter.  Hence the “salty.” This is the third in my week-long celebration of Campari drinks.,Requirements:Cruzan Black Strap Rum (or black rum), Campari, pineapple juice, lime juice, lime wedge, simple syrup, salt.,Combine all liquid ingredients in an ice-filled shaker.  Shake and strain over a glass with ice.  Add a large pinch of salt to the top and garnish with a lime wedge or dehydrated pineapple.,Comments:Cruzan Black Strap Rumis the recommended rum for this drink. I usedGosling’sBlack Seal Rumin my mix.  It was still delicious and gave it a more complex edge over the more common white rum tropical drinks — with the help of Campari.   Though with pineapple juice in the mix, you still feel just a few steps away from the pool, beach or anyplace outdoors.   But as there are just as many Salty Bird recipes which call for white rum, you can try the mix with white rum if that’s what you have handy.  The salt topper is a nice offset to the bitterness of Campari and sweet pineapple juice.,Tags:blackrumblacksealrumcamparicruzanblackstraprumlaurenschelllittlebranchpineapplecocktailssaltybirdtropicaldrinks,October 3, 2021,October 21, 2021,April 27, 2021,Follow:,Welcome to my blog!  Feel free to look around and leave me a comment if you find something interesting or helpful.,Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.,Join 55 other subscribers,Email Address,Subscribe,More,Cointreau (orange liqueur)/Cranberry Juice/Daily Mix/Martini Monday/Vodka,Ginger Cosmo Martini,2 Jun, 2022,Bourbon/Daily Mix/Grapefruit Juice/Seasonal Sunday,Brown Derby,28 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Orange Juice/Rum/Tequila/Videos Demos,Golddigger,25 May, 2022,Daily Mix/Midori (melon)/Rum,Melon Daiquiri,21 May, 2022,Keet's Cocktails © 2022.

There are many non-alcoholic versions ofButterbeerwhich resemble butterscotch & ice cream fountain shakes and can be found online. The Harry Potter theme park, when last I saw, serves only the non-alcoholic interpretation of Butterbeer. So unless you’d like to go for the original Buttered Beer, there would seem to be much room for your own interpretation and experimentation for this desert-type drink.

Shake vigorously and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.  Add a lime wedge or orange wheel as garnish.,Comment:The peach schnapps is used fairly often in mixing, but it tends to dominate the flavor of the drink.  With that in mind, you might need to add a bit more OJ (1.5 oz instead of .75 oz.) or try squeezing a lime wedge into the drink, if only to add more balance.  Also,Difford’s Guide(of British fame) recommends stirring rather than shaking to avoid thinning the drink.  Since I add a bit more vodka, I shake it, and in turn create a good happy-hour drink as well as a good brunch or after-dinner drink.,FYI, aFuzzy Navelis the drink above without vodka.

307,2021-04,"TheHIGHLANDERcocktail is a flavorful whisky cocktail akin to the Rob Roy. It has many crazy variations. My preferred recipe is adapted from the Campbell bar, NYC.

A blended scotch like Dewar’s is fine in this mix. For an extra special Highlander, you might try it with a single malt scotch.

It didn’t hurt that the “vodka martini, shaken-not-stirred” was ordered in every James Bond movie in the 60’s.  It’s simple to make, but delicate to the drinker’s taste. Most are customized to a person’s vodka choice and amount of dry vermouth used. “Extra dry” is usually a request for just a hint of vermouth via a drop or two.

310,2020-03,"There are options when deciding on the whiskey you use in the classicMANHATTAN.  The offerings are bourbon (my favorite), rye, or blended whiskey.  People who enjoy  Manhattans with Canadian blended whiskey usually regard anything else as too over-powering for what should be a silky-smooth drink.  I think that blended whiskey leaves the drink flat, while bourbon rounds it out and gives it fuller body.  So I’ve detailed the recipe below with bourbon.  Rye whiskey is more traditional and will present a dryer Manhattan. Regardless of your whiskey choice, a maraschino cherry is added to reward you for your decisional effort.,Requirements:Bourbon, sweet vermouth, Angostura bitters, maraschino cherry, maraschino cherry juice from jar.,Combine all ingredients in a mixing glass with ice.  Stir 10-15 seconds and strain into a martini glass.  Garnish with a maraschino cherry.,History:Some accounts say that the Manhattan was created in the 1860’s by a bartender at a Manhattan bar located near Broadway & Houston Street.  It’s been suggested that it gained real popularity at a Manhattan Club banquet in the mid 1870’s. The shift from American whiskey to Canadian whiskey occurred during prohibition (1920-33) because of Canadian whiskey’s availability.,Comment:The Manhattan is probably one of the best “repeat” or re-order cocktails out there.  They’re beautiful to the eye, smooth to the tongue, chilled & minimally cherry-delicious while calming, yet uplifting.
