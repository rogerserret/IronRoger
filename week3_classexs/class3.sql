#2 Activity: Get a list of accounts from Central Bohemia using a subquery.

#with subquery:
SELECT account_id
FROM account
WHERE district_id IN

#as a JOIN:
SELECT a.account_id
FROM account a
JOIN district d ON a.district_id = d.A1

#The subquery is way more efficient than the JOIN.

# CTE's (Common Table Expressions)
# We use them when we want to join X + Y but X doesnâ€™t exist

#Example: get the total amount for each account and any account info in trans table
# then draw the table to get information
# use that table to join another table

#WITH cte_trans as
#(SELECT...);

#example:
WITH cte_loan as ( select * from loan)
select loan_id from cte_loan
where status = 'B';
