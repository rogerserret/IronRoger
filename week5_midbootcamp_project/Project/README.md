### Project brief

#### WHY (Overall goal)

The bank wants to understand the demographics and other characteristics of its customers that accept a credit card offer and that do not accept a credit card.

#### WHAT (Problem)

The observational data for these kinds of problems is somewhat limited in that often the company sees only those who respond to an offer.

#### HOW (Solution)

The bank designs a focused marketing study, with 18,000 current bank customers. This focused approach allows the bank to know who does and does not respond to the offer, and to use existing demographic data that is already available on each customer.

#### Project goals

1. Build a model that will provide insight into why some bank customers accept credit card offers.Â 
2. Help the bank find out potential areas of opportunities

### Data insights

#### Analysis

*Which elements are mainly impacting the % of acceptance of the new credit card?*

**Target:**
* income_level (The lowest the income level, the highest the acceptance of the offer) 
*credit_rating (The lowest the credit rating, the highest the acceptance of the offer. The bank should find the balance between risk and conversion.)
