### Project brief

#### WHY (Overall goal)

The bank wants to understand the demographics and other characteristics of its customers that accept a credit card offer and that do not accept a credit card.

#### WHAT (Problem)

The observational data for these kinds of problems is somewhat limited in that often the company sees only those who respond to an offer.

#### HOW (Solution)

The bank designs a focused marketing study, with 18,000 current bank customers. This focused approach allows the bank to know who does and does not respond to the offer, and to use existing demographic data that is already available on each customer.

#### Project goals

1. Build a model that will provide insight into why some bank customers accept credit card offers.¬†
2. Help the bank find out potential areas of opportunities

### Data insights

Leveraging on the [data](https://github.com/rogerserret/IronRoger/blob/main/week5_midbootcamp_project/data_mid_bootcamp_project_classification-master/creditcardmarketing.csv) we were provided with, we used [SQL](https://github.com/rogerserret/IronRoger/blob/main/week5_midbootcamp_project/Project/SQL_questions.sql) to query the data base and Tableau's and Python's data visualisation tools to explore the relationships between features.

The following dashboard visually shows the key insights that came out from that analytic process:

For further details, please refer to my [notebook](https://github.com/rogerserret/IronRoger/blob/main/week5_midbootcamp_project/Project/Mid_bootcamp_project.ipynb) or the [Tableau workbook](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/roger.serret.aracil/viz/Mid-bootcampproject/Dashboard?publish=yes).

#### Analysis

*Which elements are mainly impacting the % of acceptance of the new credit card?*

TARGET:
* **Income level** (The lowest the income level, the highest the acceptance of the offer) 
* **Credit rating** (The lowest the credit rating, the highest the acceptance of the offer) 

OFFER:
* **Reward** (Air Miles is the most effective reward, followed by Points. Cash back is the least effective one)
* **Mailer type** (Postcard converts more than double than Letter)

*Other relevant findings*:
* There is no correlation between the features ‚Äúaverage balance‚Äù, the ‚Äúquarter balances‚Äù, ‚Äúoverdraft protection‚Äù or ‚Äúown your home‚Äù and the % of "offer acceptance".
* There is no correlation between "income level" and "average balance".
* The higher the "average balance", the bigger the amount of "homes owned".

#### Prediction

CLASSIFICATION TESTED MODELS:
1. Logistic regression
2. KNN
3. Decision Trees

parlar de imabalanced data i perqu√® SMOTE

mencionar que ni feature engineering ni colinearity had a positive impact on results

### Final recommendations

* Deeply assess the risk of each customer and try to find the right balance between conversion and risk.
* Create a business case and assess which reward is better to focus on regarding its costs and it‚Äôs probability of acceptance of the offer.
* Definitely use postcards as the mailer type. Cost of postcards and letters are quite similar, the advantage is clear.
* In order to predict which customers are going to accept or not a credit card offer I would recommend using a KNN classification model combined with SMOTE.
